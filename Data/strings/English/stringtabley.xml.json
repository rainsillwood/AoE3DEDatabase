We need more troops to counter them! "},{"@_locid":"38595","#text":"We kill them and kill them, and yet more keep coming. What can we do? "},{"@_locid":"38596","#text":"Excellent! You have gathered your troops together so we can destroy them all at once.

Teaming up against me?"},{"@_locid":"38608","#text":"It takes two of you to defeat me? What kind of soldier are you, anyway?"},{"@_locid":"38609","#text":"Now you see our true power. We fight as a team, my ally and I. You cannot stop us both! "},{"@_locid":"38610","#text":"You thought you had me didn't you? Admit it. You didn't reckon on reinforcements! "},{"@_locid":"38611","#text":"Excellent! You have gathered your troops together so we can destroy them all at once. How thoughtful."},{"@_locid":"38612","#text":"We  gathered our troops here specifically in hope that you would gather yours together to face us. Thank you for obliging us."},{"@_locid":"38613","#text":"Perhaps I can at least retrieve some dignity out of this debacle. Kind sir, will you accept my surrender?"},{"@_locid":"38614","#text":"No more native allies for our enemy after this attack!"},{"@_locid":"38616","#text":"Nothing I can do can save my town now. I am doomed. There is nothing but surrender left to me. Will you accept it?"},{"@_locid":"38617","#text":"My explorer has been hurt. I don't suppose you could spare a soldier or two to help him back into action?"},{"@_locid":"38618","#text":"You have failed. I have successfully retrieved my explorer."},{"@_locid":"38619","#text":"You could not hold my crafty explorer for long. "},{"@_locid":"38620","#text":"My explorer is back with me and as good as new. "},{"@_locid":"38621","#text":"Your native allies cannot save you."},{"@_locid":"38622","#text":"I didn't want that particular native town anyway."},{"@_locid":"38623","#text":"What do you think you are doing? Killing settlers violates all civilized laws of war."},{"@_locid":"38624","#text":"Stop chasing my settlers at once. You have fair warning."},{"@_locid":"38625","#text":"I warn you. Continue raiding my settlers and I shall respond in kind. "},{"@_locid":"38626","#text":"I shall destroy the enemy trading post here."},{"@_locid":"38627","#text":"Your army may be massive, but my heart is pure, and my soldiers each fight with the strength of ten."},{"@_locid":"38628","#text":"You certainly have a lot of soldiers. I suspect this means you've skimped on equipping and training them."},{"@_locid":"38629","#text":"Hmm. Nice large army. Let's see how it holds up in battle."},{"@_locid":"38630","#text":"Your army doesn't seem quite large enough to  be a threat. I wonder what you plan to do with it."},{"@_locid":"38631","#text":"I see your force maneuvering in the wilderness. Perhaps it's worth my while to destroy it."},{"@_locid":"38632","#text":"I doubt you dare attack me with an army that size."},{"@_locid":"38633","#text":"You'd better pick up your toys and scurry home."},{"@_locid":"38634","#text":"What a tiny army! Is this a trick of some kind?"},{"@_locid":"38635","#text":"I imagine the reason your army is so small is that you'd hoped in vain that it would escape notice. "},{"@_locid":"38636","#text":"You are causing me serious discomfort."},{"@_locid":"38637","#text":"I want a base here. Soon it will teem with soldiers."},{"@_locid":"38638","#text":"Please ... have mercy! "},{"@_locid":"38639","#text":"Can we discuss a temporary cease fire? Perhaps your troops could use a break from their labors. "},{"@_locid":"38640","#text":"Your town is rather out on a limb, isn't it?"},{"@_locid":"38641","#text":"Feeling standoffish I see - didn't want to be too near your smelly old neighbors?"},{"@_locid":"38642","#text":"I can see your town now. My soldiers know where to head! "},{"@_locid":"38643","#text":"Thank you for putting your town in such an obvious spot. It was easy to discover."},{"@_locid":"38644","#text":"You must be afraid of me - your towns are so near to one another."},{"@_locid":"38645","#text":"You built so very very near your ally. I wonder if it is some kind of strange plan, or just a mistake?"},{"@_locid":"38646","#text":"Did you forget something? Like progressing in Age?"},{"@_locid":"38647","#text":"You certainly are quick to jump up in Age. I suspect this indicates that your economy is lagging well behind mine."},{"@_locid":"38648","#text":"I am going to build a town here."},{"@_locid":"38651","#text":"How impolite. That treasure was clearly intended for me."},{"@_locid":"38652","#text":"Off to a good beginning!"},{"@_locid":"38653","#text":"You have scooped up so many treasures. What a fine fellow!"},{"@_locid":"38654","#text":"I appreciate your letting me collect all the treasure, but I have enough. Really. You can get some now if you like."},{"@_locid":"38655","#text":"A fine treasure indeed. I can't imagine why you hadn't gathered it already."},{"@_locid":"38657","#text":"Now that you are so far advanced in Age, your uniforms must seem fine indeed. But I doubt your fighting quality has improved."},{"@_locid":"38658","#text":"My next town center is to be at this location."},{"@_locid":"38660","#text":"Your success in making discoveries may help console you when you have lost the war."},{"@_locid":"38661","#text":"I see you are wasting your time on penny-ante looting."},{"@_locid":"38662","#text":"A paltry treasure here or there makes no difference in the long run."},{"@_locid":"38663","#text":"You are so backward! What will your soldiers use to fight mine? Clubs? "},{"@_locid":"38664","#text":"You are so nice, to choose to fight me while you are an Age inferior. How sweet."},{"@_locid":"38666","#text":"So soon? I must marshal my forces."},{"@_locid":"38669","#text":"Native warriors are brave and resourceful."},{"@_locid":"38672","#text":"This wealth will go straight into my war chest."},{"@_locid":"38673","#text":"See how my explorer makes good use of his time? You can learn by my example."},{"@_locid":"38674","#text":"Every time I make such a lucrative discovery, it's one less find for you."},{"@_locid":"38675","#text":"That's pretty bold of you, coming that near to my base."},{"@_locid":"38676","#text":"What daring! Stealing a treasure from under my very nose!"},{"@_locid":"38677","#text":"You made the first find?! Hmph. Beginner's luck."},{"@_locid":"38678","#text":"Don't you realize that these paltry treasures don't count in the long run?"},{"@_locid":"38679","#text":"You are good at exploring the wilderness, but other skills will be needed once the fighting begins in earnest."},{"@_locid":"38680","#text":"The native tribes will be good to have at our side."},{"@_locid":"38681","#text":"You must have a lot of time on your hands, to waste it gathering treasures."},{"@_locid":"38682","#text":"Can't you find anything? Perhaps it's because my gallant explorer has already gathered up all the treasures."},{"@_locid":"38683","#text":"I really appreciate your leaving all the treasure-gathering to me. It's too kind."},{"@_locid":"38684","#text":"Heehee! I have stolen one of your treasures right from under your nose! "},{"@_locid":"38685","#text":"Saving that treasure for later? Too late now!"},{"@_locid":"38686","#text":"I feel bad about this, but I don't have enough resources to obey you."},{"@_locid":"38687","#text":"Sorry. I'm too poor to do that."},{"@_locid":"38688","#text":"I have not trained an army yet."},{"@_locid":"38689","#text":"Sorry, I don't have any troops."},{"@_locid":"38690","#text":"If I had a few more men, they would rush to your aid."},{"@_locid":"38691","#text":"Alas, we have all but lost. I regret I was not a more useful ally to you."},{"@_locid":"38692","#text":"In a minute it will all be over. Next time I will apply myself more effectively."},{"@_locid":"38693","#text":"(laughs) You fought magnificently. Victory will be ours in moments."},{"@_locid":"38694","#text":"Prepare to celebrate. In one minute we will have won."},{"@_locid":"38695","#text":"Your sovereign remedy for this battle is to field more artillery units!"},{"@_locid":"38696","#text":"I suggest you construct additional artillery units."},{"@_locid":"38697","#text":"I recommend you bring more cavalry to bear in this battle at once."},{"@_locid":"38698","#text":"Cavalry, commander! You need more cavalry in that fight!"},{"@_locid":"38699","#text":"Your forces in this battle need more infantry units."},{"@_locid":"38700","#text":"If you field more infantry for that battle you'll fare better."},{"@_locid":"38701","#text":"He who defends everything defends nothing. I strongly suggest retreat. "},{"@_locid":"38702","#text":"Unless you want to lose every soldier in that army, I recommend you retreat now."},{"@_locid":"38703","#text":"The clash of several armies shatters the lands. Guard against a decisive blow!"},{"@_locid":"38704","#text":"Troops from several armies fight here. We must coordinate our efforts to wrench victory from this chaos."},{"@_locid":"38705","#text":"To defeat you I applied one of my most fundamental principles: I attacked briskly and with good order, always endeavoring to gain ground."},{"@_locid":"38706","#text":"It has been my military tradition to win. Yours is shaping up to be defeated."},{"@_locid":"38707","#text":"The outcome of that battle has left me speechless. However, the outcome of the war will speak of my victory."},{"@_locid":"38708","#text":"That battle was not one I care to have the history books learn about."},{"@_locid":"38709","#text":"My bold attitude alone would have been enough to win that battle."},{"@_locid":"38710","#text":"I presume you foresaw the outcome of that battle as plainly as I did: victory."},{"@_locid":"38711","#text":"I am pleased with the outcome of that fight after all."},{"@_locid":"38712","#text":"In the battle at hand our enemy shall feel the imposition of my heel upon his face."},{"@_locid":"38713","#text":"My reputation alone would be enough to rout their army in this fight."},{"@_locid":"38714","#text":"Your arrival was timely; the battle is turning in our favor."},{"@_locid":"38715","#text":"I have to admit I am very glad you have arrived."},{"@_locid":"38716","#text":"Alert, my ally -- an additional opponent has joined the fray and our prospects for victory here fade quickly!"},{"@_locid":"38717","#text":"The battle is going against us."},{"@_locid":"38718","#text":"This will be a bitter conflict; the enemy's numbers have increased."},{"@_locid":"38719","#text":"We now face another foe as well."},{"@_locid":"38720","#text":"Of course."},{"@_locid":"38721","#text":"Yes, your request is exactly what I would have suggested."},{"@_locid":"38722","#text":"Not an issue.

I request to resign."},{"@_locid":"39115","#text":"You may have stopped me on one front, but there are other ways to win."},{"@_locid":"39116","#text":"I see you have taken the lead in recruiting native allies.

Soon enough all you'll have to eat is sauerkraut."},{"@_locid":"39123","#text":"Your focus is on collecting treasures.

You, however, have ... well, nothing significant at all."},{"@_locid":"39131","#text":"Another treasure on the New World is mine."},{"@_locid":"39132","#text":"One more treasure for me, one less for you. Fitting, really."},{"@_locid":"39133","#text":"A treasure has granted me more coin. As if I needed it."},{"@_locid":"39134","#text":"This food tastes good.

I am doing everything I can to reduce the time you suffer before you fall."},{"@_locid":"39139","#text":"More wood for me. I am gaining everything I need for a swift victory."},{"@_locid":"39140","#text":"While you gather alliances with natives, my empire prepares to build cannon."},{"@_locid":"39141","#text":"You may have found a foothold on the trading route, but will that really help you when my armies storm your empire?"},{"@_locid":"39142","#text":"I admire your strategy. It won't bring you victory, but I admire it."},{"@_locid":"39143","#text":"I hope you remember how to get back to the Old World. The New World will soon belong to me."},{"@_locid":"39144","#text":"Your rating has dropped precipitously. Think of our next confrontation as a clinic."},{"@_locid":"39145","#text":"In this battle I will whip your hindquarters almost as hard as my father whipped mine, when I dared to write poetry!"},{"@_locid":"39146","#text":"How did you increase your rating that much? I can only assume bribery."},{"@_locid":"39147","#text":"I see that your rating has increased a great deal since last we met. It will be all the more enjoyable to flatten you."},{"@_locid":"39148","#text":"Your rating is higher, but your choices in battle will no doubt be just as predictable as before."},{"@_locid":"39149","#text":"How nice that you have increased your rating. On my side, I look forward to increasing my victory count by one."},{"@_locid":"39150","#text":"You have gained much experience since we met last, but I doubt you'll be able to apply it toward a victory."},{"@_locid":"39151","#text":"I suppose you are proud to have earned some more experience since we last met. It is the last you'll ever get."},{"@_locid":"39152","#text":"You've collected a lot more experience since we met last. I hope you will apply it to providing me with some small challenge."},{"@_locid":"39153","#text":"Ah, I see your experience has increased. Too bad you cannot buy military ability with it."},{"@_locid":"39154","#text":"You go down with the ship. I will escape with the women and children."},{"@_locid":"39155","#text":"Which Mediterranean island will you retire to once these swine have been conquered?"},{"@_locid":"39156","#text":"The new heavy artillery are miracles of modern science.

Artillery is just what we need."},{"@_locid":"39178","#text":"Very good. Artillery with cavalry support will certainly pave the road to our victory."},{"@_locid":"39179","#text":"A wise choice. Artillery and infantry are the backbone of any successful army."},{"@_locid":"39180","#text":"Right. I will bolster our forces with cavalry."},{"@_locid":"39181","#text":"When the enemy hears my storm of thundering hooves and crashing cannonballs, they will surely flee for their lives."},{"@_locid":"39182","#text":"Yes I think that will work splendidly. Infantry and cavalry make a very strong combination."},{"@_locid":"39183","#text":"Well then, I shall flood the battlefields with legions of infantry."},{"@_locid":"39185","#text":"The enemy will surely be at our mercy of our crusading infantry and noble steeds."},{"@_locid":"39186","#text":"I regret to say my strained economy simply cannot bear such a burden."},{"@_locid":"39187","#text":"Unfortunately I have spent too much money on wine, women, and song to afford that."},{"@_locid":"39188","#text":"Regretfully, I must decline."},{"@_locid":"39189","#text":"I wish I could, but I cannot."},{"@_locid":"39190","#text":"My army is non-existent.

I should be advancing shortly."},{"@_locid":"39212","#text":"The natives are restless ... and what is worse, they are allied with the enemy!"},{"@_locid":"39213","#text":"This could be bad.

Infantry and a few artillery pieces for show."},{"@_locid":"40078","#text":"Hordes of infantry is what we Russians are best at producing.

Let the enemy try to come through THESE walls!"},{"@_locid":"40103","#text":"Quickly! We must destroy one of the enemy posts or all is lost!"},{"@_locid":"40104","#text":"Curse their eyes! The enemy has four trading posts.

I see by your multiplayer score that you have been having trouble lately. Well, perhaps this fight will turn things around for you."},{"@_locid":"40111","#text":"Your multiplayer rating makes it clear that you have been suffering defeats. Do not dwell on the past!

Excellent!"},{"@_locid":"40113","#text":"How strong your Home City looks this time. I am impressed."},{"@_locid":"40114","#text":"We were here last time.

Victory or death!"},{"@_locid":"40117","#text":"Hurrah! It is you again.

This time I vow to be stronger."},{"@_locid":"40119","#text":"Do not make me do all the work like last time."},{"@_locid":"40120","#text":"Do not leave all the work in making discoveries to me.

I will be just as aggressive on your behalf as I was trying to defeat you."},{"@_locid":"40123","#text":"Those knaves! Let us seek immediate retribution upon their bodies. They will pay for their insolence!"},{"@_locid":"40124","#text":"The foe may have gotten the first native alliance, but they will not have the last one."},{"@_locid":"40125","#text":"Why are you just sitting there? The enemy has a native alliance. And we do not!"},{"@_locid":"40126","#text":"Ah, the enemy has a trading post. That should be a juicy nugget for our raiders."},{"@_locid":"40127","#text":"An enemy trading post? Already? They are more competent that I thought."},{"@_locid":"40128","#text":"They keep getting more native allies. This gives us more juicy targets to pick from for our attacks."},{"@_locid":"40129","#text":"Our foe seems very interested in trade. Perhaps that indicates he would lose spirit if we were to strike at them."},{"@_locid":"40130","#text":"Yes! A never ending stream of native warriors!"},{"@_locid":"40131","#text":"Don't you want some of the treasures too?"},{"@_locid":"40132","#text":"With the wealth we earn from trade we can bury our foes."},{"@_locid":"40133","#text":"Good, good - now that we have native allies, let us train as many as possible before the enemy does something about it."},{"@_locid":"40134","#text":"The enemy are slow and weak. That is why we were able to conquer this trade route first."},{"@_locid":"40135","#text":"The enemy's attempt to defeat us with their puny four of a kind has been crushed under my boot heel."},{"@_locid":"40136","#text":"With these native warriors I can swamp my foe by sheer numbers."},{"@_locid":"40137","#text":"Money greases the wheels of warfare. That is what this trading post is for."},{"@_locid":"40138","#text":"If one native ally is good, more are better!"},{"@_locid":"40139","#text":"If one trading post is good, more are better!"},{"@_locid":"40140","#text":"This fight may be tougher than the last one, but I am tougher, too!"},{"@_locid":"40141","#text":"I see you have decided to face weaker opposition than last time. That is fine - I have nothing against massacres."},{"@_locid":"40142","#text":"I took this treasure since you had not bothered to do so yourself. Too busy no doubt."},{"@_locid":"40143","#text":"Only one minute!  Inconceivable! Attack, attack, attack, for we are at the critical moment! "},{"@_locid":"40144","#text":"Ha! We have them by the short hairs now. One minute left before our enemy's total humiliation! "},{"@_locid":"40145","#text":"Just one short minute and the game ends. Our foe is doomed and all because of my... er... I mean \"our\" power."},{"@_locid":"40146","#text":"I have crushed our common foe's attempt to subvert the natives."},{"@_locid":"40147","#text":"What pleasure to see his town crumble as his peasants try hopelessly to flee."},{"@_locid":"40148","#text":"I love razing towns. It's what I do best."},{"@_locid":"40149","#text":"I have ruined his trading route."},{"@_locid":"40150","#text":"My troops have been repulsed by his defenses - temporarily."},{"@_locid":"40151","#text":"I cannot believe I didn't destroy his native alliance. What has gone wrong?"},{"@_locid":"40152","#text":"His town still stands, but at least we hurt him."},{"@_locid":"40153","#text":"You did not need this treasure, obviously, since otherwise you would have taken it by now."},{"@_locid":"40154","#text":"Well, it was only a trading post. Nothing too critical."},{"@_locid":"40155","#text":"That action is totally impossible."},{"@_locid":"40156","#text":"Hurry, hurry! Rescue my people here!"},{"@_locid":"40157","#text":"A disaster is in the brewing! We must rush all available troops to this place!"},{"@_locid":"40158","#text":"Do not kill all the enemy before I get there!"},{"@_locid":"40159","#text":"Save some for me!"},{"@_locid":"40160","#text":"I want to kill some of them too! My men are rushing to your side."},{"@_locid":"40161","#text":"Keep fighting. We are almost there."},{"@_locid":"40162","#text":"Do not worry about how many men YOU lose. My men will replace your fallen. Just worry about how many of THEM you slay."},{"@_locid":"40163","#text":"With me by your side, we will drive off the enemy in confusion and defeat."},{"@_locid":"40164","#text":"I have commanded an attack at this position."},{"@_locid":"40165","#text":"My explorer will not be useful for a time.

Our foes have no chance."},{"@_locid":"40167","#text":"In trying to prepare my unstoppable army, I have neglected my economy.

Do you have any you can lend to me?"},{"@_locid":"40170","#text":"My supply lines are barren of food. I need it badly."},{"@_locid":"40171","#text":"Without more wood, my progress will stop indefinitely. Do you have some?"},{"@_locid":"40172","#text":"I have a wood shortage. Kindly send some along."},{"@_locid":"40173","#text":"Sound the war cry! Charge! "},{"@_locid":"40174","#text":"Onward my soldiers! No quarter! "},{"@_locid":"40175","#text":"Death! Death to all who would stand in our way! "},{"@_locid":"40176","#text":"My explorer is incapacitated.

Now let us take the battle to HIS base."},{"@_locid":"40180","#text":"So shall all our enemies die!"},{"@_locid":"40181","#text":"Now we have them on the run! Keep attacking!"},{"@_locid":"40182","#text":"Look at them take to their heels! The cowards!"},{"@_locid":"40183","#text":"I know just how to spend this."},{"@_locid":"40184","#text":"With this shipment, I can prepare a mountain of pain for the enemy."},{"@_locid":"40185","#text":"My men will eat well tonight."},{"@_locid":"40186","#text":"I can use this wood for many things -- all of which will harm our foe."},{"@_locid":"40187","#text":"My explorer has failed us both.

Thank you."},{"@_locid":"67301","#text":"Our watchful eye misses nothing. Every time the enemy moves, it is with our say so."},{"@_locid":"67302","#text":"Our enemies are foolish to believe they will find such a simple victory."},{"@_locid":"67303","#text":"The smoke from this village will be a warning that we should not be crossed."},{"@_locid":"67304","#text":"It is a pity, but those villagers should have known better than to live on a battlefield."},{"@_locid":"67305","#text":"We take one more step towards a resounding victory."},{"@_locid":"67306","#text":"The ghosts of the departed shall haunt this place for all time. We had no choice."},{"@_locid":"67307","#text":"If we cannot strike the enemy's heart, we will have to settle for his greedy hand."},{"@_locid":"67308","#text":"Trade is dear to our enemies, and anything dear to them is a target to us."},{"@_locid":"67309","#text":"My armies require more training. They have been repelled by savages."},{"@_locid":"67310","#text":"The natives have fallen for the lies of our enemy. They resist us."},{"@_locid":"67311","#text":"I am ashamed to admit that the enemy's settlement remains. It is a harsh reminder my of weaknesses."},{"@_locid":"67312","#text":"Our invasion was a crushing failure. We will regroup and try again."},{"@_locid":"67313","#text":"This trading post bristles with defenses."},{"@_locid":"67314","#text":"The traders defend their precious money with their lives. They will die before relenting."},{"@_locid":"67315","#text":"The gods abandon me. My monk is dead and can no longer commune with the spirits."},{"@_locid":"67316","#text":"Without a monk, our flow of riches will dry up. This is a dark day."},{"@_locid":"67317","#text":"No man deserves such a horrible death. We will give him a holy burial."},{"@_locid":"67318","#text":"It is right that one so in tune with nature shall be consumed by it."},{"@_locid":"67319","#text":"A withered heart beats beneath these bones. Old men have no place on the battlefield."},{"@_locid":"67320","#text":"You are quite capable. Perhaps it is time you continued on without me."},{"@_locid":"67321","#text":"Send your men to my aid. This war spreads like fire across the land. "},{"@_locid":"67322","#text":"My men battle to their last breaths. Will you stand by and let this happen?"},{"@_locid":"67323","#text":"The sun will set on my empire unless you reach it in time."},{"@_locid":"67324","#text":"Like flies on a corpse, the enemy buzzes over me. I need reinforcements... and quickly."},{"@_locid":"67325","#text":"Greetings.

This challenge will be unlike those you have faced before."},{"@_locid":"67329","#text":"Your skills are great, but this conflict will be greater. It is a war for the ages."},{"@_locid":"67330","#text":"Our last meeting must have dealt your confidence a fatal blow. This will be an easy battle."},{"@_locid":"67331","#text":"You choose the easy path. Glory on the battlefield is won through facing a challenge, not running from it."},{"@_locid":"67332","#text":"We never should have fought as enemies. I always found your leadership exceptional."},{"@_locid":"67333","#text":"Last time we met, you mastered me.

This time, however, it is I who will lead our alliance."},{"@_locid":"67335","#text":"I will follow in your footsteps. Last time we fought together, you were clearly the force to be feared. "},{"@_locid":"67336","#text":"I extend the hand of friendship to you. Please do not hold an old grudge against a new ally."},{"@_locid":"67337","#text":"Last time, good fortune smiled upon me, but I believe that you will dominate this campaign."},{"@_locid":"67338","#text":"We have a great advantage in this campaign, for every rock and every tree is familiar."},{"@_locid":"67339","#text":"We could have never predicted our last defeat. Let us leave it in the past, and think of the future."},{"@_locid":"67340","#text":"I promise you, our last adventure taught me much. An old dog can in fact learn new tricks."},{"@_locid":"67341","#text":"Our last battle plan proved very successful. I hope we can duplicate the results."},{"@_locid":"67342","#text":"In turbulent times such as these, a solid alliance is invaluable."},{"@_locid":"67343","#text":"Monks are men of great power. They are worth any price."},{"@_locid":"67344","#text":"I have paid a steep ransom for this man, but I believe he will repay his debt with action."},{"@_locid":"67345","#text":"This monk has given his life for our cause. The least we can do is give some coin for his."},{"@_locid":"67346","#text":"I have rescued a monk from the hands of our enemies. They will pay for their cruelty."},{"@_locid":"67347","#text":"My monk will never be the same man he was, but he lives to see another day."},{"@_locid":"67348","#text":"It is a joyous day when one of our own is brought home safely."},{"@_locid":"67349","#text":"A general must always lead with caution, but such an opportunity is a rare thing. "},{"@_locid":"67350","#text":"Put your warriors on alert. The enemy does not know what awaits them."},{"@_locid":"67351","#text":"Do you see it? An enemy town lies undefended, like a tiger with its teeth pulled out."},{"@_locid":"67352","#text":"There is no soldier in sight. We must attack."},{"@_locid":"67353","#text":"This town will react slowly without riders to protect it. Our cavalry will trample them into the dirt."},{"@_locid":"67354","#text":"A town without a stable is a town without hope. We should take advantage."},{"@_locid":"67355","#text":"I am always willing to share my wealth with a friend."},{"@_locid":"67356","#text":"How you spend this coin is none of my concern.

There is always more coin here if you need it."},{"@_locid":"67358","#text":"My men will halve their rations so yours may eat."},{"@_locid":"67359","#text":"We fight for the same cause. Therefore we should share the same bread."},{"@_locid":"67360","#text":"Take this gift of wood. I am sure you would do the same for me.

Please, take this wood."},{"@_locid":"67362","#text":"It is time to march on the enemy settlement."},{"@_locid":"67363","#text":"I wish to end this war before it can grow bloodier. Watch over me as I journey into battle."},{"@_locid":"67364","#text":"To kill a weed, you must remove its roots. To kill a ruler, you must remove his villagers."},{"@_locid":"67365","#text":"A master's greatest assets are his servants. Without villagers, our enemy will flounder."},{"@_locid":"67366","#text":"Every fallen villager weakens our enemy."},{"@_locid":"67367","#text":"All of the conditions are right for a massive assault. The Son of Heaven has his eye on the enemy stronghold."},{"@_locid":"67368","#text":"I march towards what I hope will be the final battle. If I do not return, remember me fondly."},{"@_locid":"67369","#text":"Our attack has begun. The enemy will rest peaceful this night. They will sleep the sleep of the dead."},{"@_locid":"67370","#text":"The natives do not know they are pawns. We will have to win them to our side by force."},{"@_locid":"67371","#text":"Every village we claim is one fewer rock for the enemy to hide under."},{"@_locid":"67372","#text":"My men move to snatch a trading post from the enemy's grasp."},{"@_locid":"67373","#text":"Before this day is over, a trading post will burn to the ground."},{"@_locid":"67374","#text":"You no longer need to peer over your shoulder, my warriors make haste to your position."},{"@_locid":"67375","#text":"Allies fight together, not alone."},{"@_locid":"67376","#text":"Hold your ground for a few moments more. The Son of Heaven closes the distance between us."},{"@_locid":"67377","#text":"This spot looks fertile for a growing army."},{"@_locid":"67378","#text":"Many a warrior will find his purpose here, where I break this ground."},{"@_locid":"67379","#text":"With this building, I claim this land for the Son of Heaven."},{"@_locid":"67380","#text":"This shall be the beating heart of a new Chinese empire."},{"@_locid":"67381","#text":"On this piece of dirt, an empire is born. You will always be welcome here, ally."},{"@_locid":"67382","#text":"It is a pity we must wage war. This town center seems to sit in paradise itself."},{"@_locid":"67383","#text":"Every village that does not submit to me could submit to my enemy. I must prevent this."},{"@_locid":"67384","#text":"This native village will wake to find itself subject to a new ruler."},{"@_locid":"67385","#text":"Claiming this village will bring us one step closer to victory. "},{"@_locid":"67386","#text":"This trade site belongs to the Son of Heaven."},{"@_locid":"67387","#text":"The sooner we establish trade dominance, the harder it will be for our enemy to resist our influence."},{"@_locid":"67388","#text":"My men will not be forced from this building. They will come out only as corpses."},{"@_locid":"67389","#text":"I will not abandon my people. We will defend this building at all costs."},{"@_locid":"67390","#text":"This piece of land is dear to us. If my men fall here, it will be their last act."},{"@_locid":"67391","#text":"Stay alert. My warriors will defend this patch of land, but may need your aid."},{"@_locid":"67392","#text":"It is right for a ruler to defend those in his domain. I will defend this village to the death."},{"@_locid":"67393","#text":"You will not win the respect of your subjects with weakness. This village must be defended."},{"@_locid":"67394","#text":"It may be unwise, but I will not give up this town. An emperor rules by example."},{"@_locid":"67395","#text":"Subjects of the Qing Dynasty will fight back against any invader."},{"@_locid":"67396","#text":"This trade site will be defended, against all odds."},{"@_locid":"67397","#text":"We have fought bravely for this trade site. It will not fall easily into the hands of our enemy."},{"@_locid":"67398","#text":"A steady trickle of wealth is yours for the spending."},{"@_locid":"67399","#text":"Whenever you have the need for coin, I will satisfy it. "},{"@_locid":"67400","#text":"As an emperor, I am a provider. Your people will never want for food."},{"@_locid":"67401","#text":"I have no shortage of wood in my empire. Take what you need, and save the rest for later."},{"@_locid":"67402","#text":"I have never abandoned an ally. My men rush to your aid, I only hope they reach you in time."},{"@_locid":"67403","#text":"I feel every one of your wounds. I am coming. Hold on for as long as you can."},{"@_locid":"67404","#text":"The enemy will see an example of true solidarity. I have sent warriors to join you."},{"@_locid":"67405","#text":"Is there anything I can do for you as we prepare for our next attack?"},{"@_locid":"67406","#text":"I would like once again to express my gratitude for your friendship. It has served my people quite well."},{"@_locid":"67407","#text":"As one ruler to another, could I ask for a loan of coin?"},{"@_locid":"67408","#text":"It pains me to ask, but can you spare some coin for a fading emperor? "},{"@_locid":"67409","#text":"It has been a lean time in my empire. My people look to you for nourishment."},{"@_locid":"67410","#text":"My friend, a small gift of wood is needed. Can you oblige?"},{"@_locid":"67411","#text":"Could an ally spare several logs from his fire? My villages need wood."},{"@_locid":"67412","#text":"I will never forget this heroic act. Your men will go down as legends in my empire."},{"@_locid":"67413","#text":"So it is true. Together, we can overcome any obstacle."},{"@_locid":"67414","#text":"You have once again earned my trust. Thank you for joining me."},{"@_locid":"67415","#text":"My advisors were beginning to worry. The coin is appreciated."},{"@_locid":"67416","#text":"Even an emperor can use additional coin. Many thanks."},{"@_locid":"67417","#text":"I have never been unable to provide for my people. This food helps."},{"@_locid":"67418","#text":"We are at war. Starvation should not be claiming our people. Thank you."},{"@_locid":"67419","#text":"You are more than an ally, you are a friend. Your act has saved my people."},{"@_locid":"67420","#text":"This is a moment when I have few words. Thank you. I thought my empire was surely doomed."},{"@_locid":"67421","#text":"Your warriors will always have a home in this town they have defended."},{"@_locid":"67422","#text":"I realize how much these resources mean to you. They will not be wasted."},{"@_locid":"67423","#text":"Thank you. These come just in time."},{"@_locid":"67424","#text":"Your donation of wood could not have come at a better time."},{"@_locid":"67425","#text":"An old man often forgets the essentials. Thank you for the wood."},{"@_locid":"67426","#text":"The Aztecs tighten their grip on our throats. Soon we will be unable to breathe. "},{"@_locid":"67427","#text":"Our armies stumble in their efforts, weakened by the superior Aztec enemy."},{"@_locid":"67428","#text":"The British have beaten our men bloody. Is there any way for us to recover?"},{"@_locid":"67429","#text":"I knew the British were strong, but not this strong."},{"@_locid":"67430","#text":"Losing to the Dutch would be a disaster, yet I cannot find their weakness."},{"@_locid":"67431","#text":"This old man cannot stomach one more defeat, whether its the Dutch or anyone else."},{"@_locid":"67432","#text":"Our weak defense betrays us. Even if we survive, the French will be as strong as ever."},{"@_locid":"67433","#text":"The French do not even notice our resistance, as if we were insects to be ignored."},{"@_locid":"67434","#text":"Germans stampede across the landscape. I am getting too old for this."},{"@_locid":"67435","#text":"I have seen much in my time, but never an enemy as terrifying as the Germans."},{"@_locid":"67436","#text":"I thought our alliance supreme, but the Haudenosaunee shatter it with one blow."},{"@_locid":"67437","#text":"Even if we live to see another day, the Haudenosaunee will be there to greet us when we wake."},{"@_locid":"67438","#text":"Killing is a sport to these Ottomans. I have nothing left to offer them but my death."},{"@_locid":"67439","#text":"Is this the death of our empire? I only hope we showed these Ottomans the meaning of honor."},{"@_locid":"67440","#text":"They may crush us easily, but I will never, ever submit to the Portuguese."},{"@_locid":"67441","#text":"My fortunes never suggested such abuse at the hands of the Portuguese."},{"@_locid":"67442","#text":"Every time a warrior falls, I expect the Russian assault to cease. But it never does."},{"@_locid":"67443","#text":"The Russians thrive on our anguish. There is no diplomacy when you deal with animals."},{"@_locid":"67446","#text":"I am at a loss for ideas, my friend. The Spanish test us in ways I never imagined."},{"@_locid":"67447","#text":"This is no longer a battlefield. Thanks to the Spanish, it has become a graveyard."},{"@_locid":"67448","#text":"I fear that these traitorous Chinese will defeat the very emperor that they betrayed: Me. "},{"@_locid":"67449","#text":"I am ashamed to admit that the Chinese traitors mistreat us. They have made a fool of me."},{"@_locid":"67450","#text":"Where is our honor? Where is our courage? Our warriors retreat from the Japanese."},{"@_locid":"67451","#text":"When a Japanese warrior falls it is only after killing five our men. We must do something."},{"@_locid":"67452","#text":"The Indians have marched back with renewed strength."},{"@_locid":"67453","#text":"I look into the future and see an Indian dawn. Unless we act now, our time is over."},{"@_locid":"67454","#text":"We must survive long enough to strike back with a ferocity the Aztecs have never seen."},{"@_locid":"67455","#text":"The British have wasted their greatest warriors in gaining the advantage. Now it is our turn."},{"@_locid":"67456","#text":"The Dutch fight back fiercely, but they cannot do so for long."},{"@_locid":"67457","#text":"The French pour their strongest into this offensive, but leave little reserves to continue. "},{"@_locid":"67458","#text":"Even as we feel the tips of their blades, they weaken. The Germans will not last."},{"@_locid":"67459","#text":"Our men may die, but the Haudenosaunee weaken. Soon we will have our revenge."},{"@_locid":"67460","#text":"Ottomans think not of the future. They may weaken us, but our vengeance will be final."},{"@_locid":"67461","#text":"It is wrong of the Portuguese to show such cruelty, especially when they are so weak. "},{"@_locid":"67462","#text":"We will lie in wait, taking the Russians' damage, but preparing for retaliation."},{"@_locid":"67464","#text":"Every blow costs the Spanish morale and energy. When they are depleted, we strike."},{"@_locid":"67465","#text":"All we have to do is stay alive long enough to slaughter the traitorous Chinese."},{"@_locid":"67466","#text":"Once we pull out of harm's way, we will strike, and finish these Japanese for good."},{"@_locid":"67467","#text":"We may be losing, but the Indians have little left to give. One more attack will be their undoing."},{"@_locid":"67468","#text":"It is up to you to lead us to victory, my friend. The sun has set on the Qing Dynasty. "},{"@_locid":"67469","#text":"One more time I come to you on my knees, ally. Pull this battle from the flames of defeat."},{"@_locid":"67470","#text":"I will not give up until the enemy is vanquished and you have been returned to your former glory."},{"@_locid":"67471","#text":"We may weaken, but I still have the strength to bring this battle to the enemy."},{"@_locid":"67472","#text":"They are wilting. We must stoke the fire and increase the heat."},{"@_locid":"67473","#text":"We must keep up this pace, striking the enemy while we have them cornered."},{"@_locid":"67474","#text":"The enemy falls, the war comes to a close, and the student becomes the master."},{"@_locid":"67475","#text":"The enemy dries up like a husk. You have taken my teachings and improved upon them."},{"@_locid":"67476","#text":"It is normal to fear, even in the face of certain victory. I will watch over you, like a grandfather to a child."},{"@_locid":"67477","#text":"The battle goes well, but the war is far from over. I will get us through this deadly storm."},{"@_locid":"67478","#text":"Every old man learns to live with death. Yet I did not expect it so soon."},{"@_locid":"67479","#text":"I do not know if I have the energy for such a campaign. Our enemy is simply too strong."},{"@_locid":"67480","#text":"All this death has left me weary. These old bones break under the weight of our enemy."},{"@_locid":"67481","#text":"Shadows of defeat darken our futures. Enjoy the sunset. It may be our last."},{"@_locid":"67482","#text":"I have ordered my men to begin digging. The tomb of an emperor takes time, and there is little of it left."},{"@_locid":"67483","#text":"Our partnership has been one of legendary courage. Perhaps we shall meet again in the next life."},{"@_locid":"67484","#text":"The enemy wishes to end this campaign quickly, but we must resist."},{"@_locid":"67485","#text":"Little does the enemy know that their bid for victory will lead only to defeat. Now is the time to strike."},{"@_locid":"67486","#text":"The enemy claims more native lands. We must hurry, a ruler is nothing without subjects."},{"@_locid":"67487","#text":"I must admit, the enemy has charisma. The natives rally behind them."},{"@_locid":"67488","#text":"Our enemy has laid the foundation for a trade empire, but we cannot lose hope. "},{"@_locid":"67489","#text":"That trade site should have been ours. What is an alliance if we do not work together?"},{"@_locid":"67490","#text":"We watch helplessly as the people of this land fall in behind the enemy banner. It is a grim omen. "},{"@_locid":"67491","#text":"This cannot continue. The native people turn against us in droves."},{"@_locid":"67492","#text":"A wise commander would have seen this coming. Our opponents will use their vast trade to break us."},{"@_locid":"67493","#text":"Our strong start has slowed to a crawl. The enemy flaunts its trade empire in our faces."},{"@_locid":"67494","#text":"You strike like lightning! The enemy will regret not seeking your allegiance."},{"@_locid":"67495","#text":"Natives can be  the key to victory or defeat. You will not regret this act."},{"@_locid":"67496","#text":"Yours is a remarkable achievement. I am proud to call you my ally."},{"@_locid":"67497","#text":"It seems you have an eye for commerce, as well as an eye for war."},{"@_locid":"67498","#text":"Such a treasure will aid us both, my friend."},{"@_locid":"67499","#text":"In war, resources are as important as weapons. "},{"@_locid":"67500","#text":"You have a keen eye for treasure. This is good, as every contribution counts."},{"@_locid":"67501","#text":"It is wise to keep the supply line flowing swiftly. "},{"@_locid":"67502","#text":"The sweet chime of coin is music to the ears of any man."},{"@_locid":"67503","#text":"Greed is not greed when it benefits a righteous cause such as ours."},{"@_locid":"67504","#text":"Warriors deserve the finest food, especially if for some it is their last meal."},{"@_locid":"67505","#text":"Do not allow your men to grow too plump in their feasting."},{"@_locid":"67506","#text":"It is a good thing we are allies, otherwise there would be no treasures left for me to discover."},{"@_locid":"67507","#text":"Never have I met a commander with a such a taste for treasure. You put me to shame."},{"@_locid":"67508","#text":"I will allow you to take what is mine this once but please look elsewhere in the future."},{"@_locid":"67509","#text":"Do you wish to offend me, my friend? Save some riches for the rest of us."},{"@_locid":"67510","#text":"It delights me to see a fresh warrior for our cause."},{"@_locid":"67511","#text":"You summon warriors to you. The powerful recognize one of their own."},{"@_locid":"67512","#text":"More subjects join you. Remember. How you treat your servants is how you treat your empire."},{"@_locid":"67513","#text":"Every man who sees you in battle wishes to pledge you his allegiance."},{"@_locid":"67514","#text":"Use this precious resource with care. Trees grow scarce rapidly."},{"@_locid":"67515","#text":"In the heat of battle, your archers will thank you for this wood."},{"@_locid":"67516","#text":"Our empire stretches in every direction, a product of your cunning strategies."},{"@_locid":"67517","#text":"You have shown that despite the enemy's strength, the people of this land are on our side."},{"@_locid":"67518","#text":"A sly move, my friend. You have put us in a very advantageous position."},{"@_locid":"67519","#text":"I see now that your steady pace has all been part of a larger plot. Well done."},{"@_locid":"67520","#text":"A wall is only effective when paired with an aggressive strategy."},{"@_locid":"67521","#text":"You make a wise choice. An enemy can only harm those within his reach."},{"@_locid":"67522","#text":"I have learned that natives must be bought with gifts and protection. I have made the first move."},{"@_locid":"67523","#text":"One can only win over the people of his empire if he holds out a hand in peace."},{"@_locid":"67524","#text":"As usual, I have chosen to set an example. This trade site will contribute much to our alliance."},{"@_locid":"67525","#text":"The land will always provide for the Son of Heaven."},{"@_locid":"67526","#text":"I gather riches easily, like a child at play."},{"@_locid":"67527","#text":"The glint of gold has given me hope for this campaign."},{"@_locid":"67528","#text":"The battle will rage on, thanks to the addition of coin to my coffers."},{"@_locid":"67529","#text":"My men will rejoice at this discovery of food."},{"@_locid":"67530","#text":"I only collect these riches because we are allies. Normally, I would have left them to you."},{"@_locid":"67531","#text":"This treasure lies close to your headquarters. I will share it, if you so desire."},{"@_locid":"67532","#text":"You are a steadfast warrior but a terrible treasure hunter. How do you expect to fund this war?"},{"@_locid":"67533","#text":"I have tried to stay silent, but one emperor cannot support two empires. Search for treasure."},{"@_locid":"67534","#text":"I have come upon warriors willing to fight beside our men."},{"@_locid":"67535","#text":"These warriors have seen much bloodshed and will make a fine addition to our army."},{"@_locid":"67536","#text":"These villagers are the foundation of our army.

I expected more from you than this brand of cowardice."},{"@_locid":"67619","#text":"It is mercy, not murder, that makes a ruler great."},{"@_locid":"67620","#text":"That shaking is not the earth but the army marching over it.

Your number of trade sites impresses, but ultimately means nothing."},{"@_locid":"67642","#text":"I see you have won the race for resources. Everything in battle is a race. "},{"@_locid":"67643","#text":"You should set your sights on the battlefield and not on scattered treasures."},{"@_locid":"67644","#text":"You have worked hard to hoard these riches.

Do not waste time on it."},{"@_locid":"67656","#text":"A wall is a good defense. But will it hold?"},{"@_locid":"67657","#text":"Other villages will see this example and bow down to the Son of Heaven."},{"@_locid":"67658","#text":"It has begun. Soon all peoples will be absorbed into my empire."},{"@_locid":"67659","#text":"In your hands, these trade sites would become corrupted.

As we developed the Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, we collaborated with Native American and First Nations consultants to correct these errors.
