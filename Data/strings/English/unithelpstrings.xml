    <string _locid="100000">In 1492 England was a modest agricultural nation recovering from the effects of long wars in which its kings attempted to retain inherited control of large parts of France. By the early eighteenth century the English ruled Great Britain, having united all the British Isles and established important colonies and outposts around the world. By the nineteenth century they controlled the world's largest empire and were the first nation to industrialize. These transformations were the result of their favorable position as an island nation, a high relative degree of personal and economic freedom, a large literate middle class, financial acumen, and a culture that encouraged action, progress, and achievement.\n \nCritical to Britain's empire building was the rise of its military, especially its navy. Beginning as raiders and privateers preying on Spanish shipping from the New World, by 1588 their sea rogues were able to defeat the immense Spanish Armada in the English Channel. Recurring European naval wars established Royal Navy standards and traditions that allowed Britain to project its trade and empire to India, Australia, China, and North America. On land, the relatively small British army earned a reputation for disciplined musketry, an excellent officer corps, and occasionally brilliant generalship.\n \nBritain established colonies on Caribbean islands and the North American continent in the early seventeenth century. The islands were the real prize at first, as sugar plantations proved enormously profitable. The small settlements in Virginia and Massachusetts expanded gradually as an accelerating flood of farmers and laborers came to North America looking for land, religious freedom, and opportunity. The colonies welcomed the poor and dispossessed not only from the home country and Ireland, but also from mainland Europe. The British colonies were bordered by the French in Canada, a small Spanish presence in Florida, and Native Americans across the mountains to the west. Victory in a middle eighteenth century world war with France, disputed from India to Europe to North America, made Canada British and opened the door to western expansion. One of Britain's few setbacks in this period was the loss of its American colonies in the revolution of 1776.</string>
    <string _locid="100001">Holland in 1500 was a small European nation, but extremely energetic, practical, and progressive, with a strong emphasis on trade. Particularly in the northern provinces, the Dutch embraced Protestant Christianity during the sixteenth century, supplanting Catholicism. They were aggressive and dynamic traders, well-positioned to transport goods to and from the Baltic and North Atlantic, and the interior of Europe up the Rhine River. They built efficient ships that carried large cargoes with small crews. Very limited in land, they developed an intense agriculture and began reclaiming lowlands from the sea.\n \nBy accident of marriage and inheritance, control of the now largely Protestant Holland shifted to Catholic Spain in the mid-sixteenth century, and Spanish kings sought, in turn, to supplant Protestantism within their realm. This led to a revolt against Spain. Although at a great disadvantage in overall wealth and power, the Dutch proved a tough opponent and drew allies to their side. By 1609 Holland was virtually independent.\n \nIn the era of colonial expansion by great empires, the Dutch pursued business opportunities. They were soon engaged in the trade with the Americas, despite Spanish attempts to exclude non-allies. The efficiency of their ships made them attractive as low-cost carriers. They built a business carrying and processing sugar and other goods out of Portuguese Brazil. When the Spanish allied with Portugal and closed the Portuguese ports to the Dutch, the Dutch seized several islands, including Aruba and Cura√ßao.\n \nIn 1610 Henry Hudson explored the North American coast and rediscovered both the river now named after him and the great harbor of modern-day New York City. After several trading voyages to the area seeking furs, the Dutch planted a small trading outpost up the river near Albany in 1614 and later a more permanent settlement on Manhattan Island. The relatively few colonists were more interested in trade profits than in establishing a lasting and well-defended colony. New Amsterdam fell easily to a British fleet commanded by the Duke of York in 1664. The Dutch regained it briefly in 1673, but ceded it permanently to Britain in 1674.\n \nThe Dutch made their biggest mark in the East Indies. Following in the wake of the Portuguese around Africa in the early 1600s, agents of the Dutch East India Company took over much of the East India trade, together with England.</string>
    <string _locid="100002">France began the age of exploration as one of the more powerful nations in Europe economically, militarily, and geographically. Initially they trailed the Spanish and Portuguese in the quest for overseas trade and empire, but made significant progress in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They were exploring and attempting to settle North America before the British, attracted by the fishing off Newfoundland, fur trading, and their search for a northwest passage around the Americas to the Pacific Ocean and Asia.\n \nA sixteenth century settlement in Florida was wiped out by the Spanish. Several attempts to settle in Nova Scotia and along the St. Lawrence River finally resulted in a permanent settlement in Quebec. From there intrepid explorers, including Champlain, Marquette, and many others, worked their way through the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi to its mouth. They established better relations with the Native Americans than any other European nation, mainly because they encouraged fur trading and were less interested in permanent settlement. French trappers and traders came to America in relatively small numbers to make a fortune in furs, and then returned home. They eventually built a string of trading posts and forts along the interior trade route at New Orleans, St. Louis, Mackinac Island, Detroit, and Fort Duquesne (modern Pittsburgh).\n \nFrench involvement in Europe, India, and the Caribbean meant that colonizing efforts in Canada were not strongly or systematically supported. The efforts of the smaller French population to keep the rapidly growing British bottled up along the Atlantic seaboard could not be sustained. When war came in the eighteenth century, Canada was lost in battle and traded at the negotiation table for some spice islands in Indonesia. The French retained their control of the Mississippi and Missouri River watersheds until the early nineteenth century, when Napoleon sold France's vast holdings to the fledgling United States to support his wars in Europe.</string>
    <string _locid="100003">At the time of Columbus' first voyage, Germany consisted of four hundred separate entities, including cities, principalities, and feudal states. Though nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire, they were in fact beyond the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Spain. There was no central government that dictated policy, collected taxes, or marshaled armies.\n \nIn 1517 a German monk, Martin Luther, protested against a variety of practices of the Catholic Church by nailing his arguments to a church door in Wittenberg. This was a traditional way of opening a debate at the university there, but he started something larger than a scholarly debate. His act set off the Protestant Reformation, as copies of his theses, translated from Latin into German and other languages, spread throughout Germany and the rest of Europe. The Reformation in turn brought about the Counter-Reformation as the Catholic Church reordered itself.\n \nThe struggle between the two religious views broke out into the Thirty Years' War, which was particularly brutal and devastating in Germany. German provinces ended up choosing to be either Catholic (primarily in the south) or Protestant (primarily in the north).\n \nThe small Baltic duchy of Prussia gradually began expanding in the sixteenth century thanks to good leadership and a growing military tradition. It repulsed Swedish encroachments in the seventeenth century and rose to real prominence under Frederick the Great in the eighteenth century. The Prussians were particularly noted for their disciplined infantry, elite Grenadiers, and cavalry. They fought a series of wars with the much larger Austrian Empire to the south, usually with great success, up to the Napoleonic Era.\n \nGermans briefly attempted to colonize Venezuela in the sixteenth century. Augsburg banking families obtained the rights to the country in 1526 and began exploring the land in 1529, mainly looking for El Dorado, the famed city of gold. Approximately two hundred settlers landed at Coro. They continued to search for gold and established some sugar plantations worked by African slaves. The colony reverted to Spanish control in 1556. Most of the German colonists had died from disease or native attacks, especially during their treks into the interior searching for gold.</string>
    <string _locid="100004">The Ottoman Empire had existed since 1300, and at its peak in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was one the world's most powerful empires, stretching from northern Africa through the Middle East, Asia Minor, the Balkans, and what is now southern Russia. The Ottomans finally took Constantinople in 1453 after many years of trying, thereby severing the city's long link with the West, back to the ancient empire of Rome. By 1529 they had pushed to the gates of Vienna and toward the western Mediterranean basin.The Ottomans appeared unstoppable, but were actually near the limit of their expansion. Europeans had been making advances in technology that the Ottomans could not match. For example, the Turks had to purchase cannons from Europe, and often had to hire European cannoneers. In 1683 they failed once more to take Vienna. At this point the string of successful Ottoman rulers came to an end, while the power and organization of their European enemies was growing.\n \nMuch of the Ottoman Empire's energy was dissipated in struggles over succession. The bureaucracy that ran the empire became unwieldy and often corrupt. The Ottomans fell behind in industry, as well. The profits they enjoyed from the trade between Asia and Europe eroded as the Europeans learned to sail directly to the East Indies. The trade balance actually reversed as the Ottomans found they needed European goods more than Europe needed theirs.\n \nEventually the Ottoman armies went into decline. The empire came to depend more on slave and captive soldiers, especially its famed Janissaries. The Europeans were generally content to let the Ottomans remain where they were, although the Russians fought for the plains north of the Black Sea. The Industrial Revolution left the Ottomans completely at the mercy of Europe. For a time the British even propped up the Ottoman Empire to keep it from being occupied by their enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="100005">In 1492 Portugal was a tiny nation of one million people perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Cut off from trade to the eastern Mediterranean by the Venetians and Ottomans, they had turned south seeking a source for the spices and gold that appeared in the markets of North Africa. By the mid-fourteenth century they had discovered several island groups in the Atlantic that they settled and planted with sugar. Under the sponsorship and support of Prince Henry, they built up their knowledge of seafaring and continued edging their way down the coast of Africa. By 1487 they had reached the southern tip of the continent, and in ten years they reached the long sought goal of India.\n \nBy accident they had discovered Brazil when blown off course and within a few decades they had a colony there collecting Brazil wood (for its dyes) and growing sugar. Portuguese navigators were very active in the further discovery of the Americas and one of their pilots, Ferdinand de Magellan, began a circumnavigation of the world in 1519 in the service of Spain. Leaving most of the New World to Spain by mutual agreement, they concentrated on their trading with the East Indies. They built trading stations at key points in Africa, India, and Malaysia, and enjoyed some very profitable years.\n \nTheir monopoly on Atlantic trade to the Indies was short-lived. They fell temporarily under Spanish rule in the late sixteenth century, which opened their shipping to attack by the Protestant Dutch and the English. Both of these enemies set up trading companies to compete in the East Indies, which came to dominate the market. Gradually the Portugese lost their lead in seafaring and fell behind other nations in technology and trade. Eventually their power and influence waned to the point that they needed a British military presence to stave off conquest by Napoleonic France.</string>
    <string _locid="100006">The largest nation in Europe by area and population, Russia in 1500 was relatively backward and far from the Renaissance that was blossoming to its west. It was striving to expand and having success mainly to the east, toward Siberia. Under Peter the Great, a particularly able Romanov Tsar, they began an effort to import western technology and knowledge, but progress was very slow. They fought both the Swedes to the north and the Ottomans to the south with some success. They were able to field large armies from the great mass of serfs (near-slaves bound for life to the estates of aristocracy). They fought stubbornly and rigidly, but that could be effective, especially in defense of their homeland.\n \nWhen Russia reached the eastern edge of Siberia, explorers were sent into the Pacific seeking the west coast of North America. Vitus Bering, a Dane with a long career in the Russian Navy, found the Bering Strait, the Bering Sea and southern Alaska in the middle 1700s. By the late 1700s they had established a small outpost in Alaskan waters and were hunting fur animals, especially the sea otter. Their small settlements and outposts eventually stretched down the American Pacific coast to northern California, but they were never very successful. In 1867 they sold Alaska to the United States.\n \nBy 1800 they had perhaps the largest army in Europe and had entered the Napoleonic Wars, switching sides as it suited them. Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 with a huge army, but the campaign was a disaster. The Russians retreated into their limitless land and even abandoned Moscow, while letting the Russian winter do its worst. The Russians followed the retreating French and helped bring about Napoleon's first abdication and exile in 1814.</string>
    <string _locid="100007">In 1492 the combined kingdoms of Aragon and Castile completed the reconquest of Spain, driving the last of the Moors back to North Africa. At this moment the discoveries of Columbus fell into their lap. They followed his first voyage with more that were disappointing at first, revealing new continents but not the Asian source of gold or riches they sought. That changed, however, when first the Aztec and then Incan civilizations were discovered in the interior. Both were destroyed in audacious and brutal campaigns, and looted of enormous treasure.\n \nThese conquests revitalized interest in the New World, and Spanish conquistadors searched north and south for more treasure and more civilizations, especially the legendary El Dorado, the city of gold. When these searches proved largely fruitless, the Spanish settled where they found precious metal to be mined, or where surviving native populations could be put to work. Other European nations and assorted pirates began preying on Spanish outposts and returning treasure fleets. While Spain fought endless wars in Europe against Protestantism, it was also engaged in the New World, defending its colonies and sources of wealth.\n \nBy the late eighteenth century Spain's opportunity for greatness on a worldwide scale had passed. The wealth it extracted from the New World had largely spent on luxuries and wasteful wars. Spain resisted change and progress at home and abroad. Its colonial system installed a ruling elite over indigenous populations. The costs of maintaining its empire outstripped the income it generated, and one by one the colonies wrested control from Spain. The Spanish fell behind the other contending nations in Europe in economic and military power, and when the French under Napoleon marched in they could offer little organized resistance.</string>
    <string _locid="100008">The most densely populated region of the New World in 1492 was Mesoamerica, where North and Central America meet in modern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula. The people living here were called the Aztecs (also Mexica or Tenochca); they built an amazing civilization centered on their great capital city of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City). This was one of the largest cities in the world (with an estimated population of 200,000), and arguably more beautiful and cleaner than any contemporary capital in Europe.\n \nThe Aztecs were just one of several tribes in the area, but had risen to prominence due to their ferocity in battle and adept diplomacy. Their soldiers wielded weapons of wood and stone, and they often sought prisoners to be sacrificed in religious ceremonies. Their society depended on sophisticated agricultural techniques; from them the world learned of foodstuffs including tomatoes, corn, cocoa, and chili peppers. They were handicapped by the lack of large domesticated animals (they had no horse or ox), and the use of the wheel only in toys. Everything to be moved was carried by human porters.\n \nDespite their large population and fighting prowess, the Aztecs fell relatively quickly to the determined Spanish conquistadores under Cortez. This was due in large part to the epidemics the Europeans brought ashore. By some estimates the Aztec population of 12 million people in 1520 had fallen to one million by 1600. The Spanish also allied with the Aztecs' enemies to increase the size of their armies, and had the advantages of steel and gunpowder weapons.</string>
    <string _locid="100009">The Carib people are believed to have migrated from the rainforests of modern Venezuela to several of the more eastern and southern islands in the Caribbean, which takes its name from this tribe. They were skilled dugout canoe builders and had the use of sails. They were the fiercest warriors in the area, adept with the blowgun and bow and arrow. Unlike the more peaceful neighboring tribes they displaced, the Carib culture valued the exploits of warriors most highly. The Spanish tended to avoid Carib-controlled islands after a number of early skirmishes.\n \nCarib cannibalism was reported by Columbus and other Spanish explorers, and may have been part of their religious rituals and war practice. In 1503 Queen Isabella of Spain ruled that cannibals could be taken legally for slaves, providing an incentive to identify potential laborers as such.\n \nBy the seventeenth century other European nations wanted the Carib islands for sugar plantations and the local population was almost annihilated. In 1796 the British deported most of the remaining 5,000 Caribs to an island off Honduras. They spread from there into the mainland and survive today in Guatemala and on a reservation in Dominica. Words of Carib origin that remain in common use today include hammock, iguana, and hurricane.</string>
    <string _locid="100010">In 1492 the Cherokee were a relatively peaceful agricultural people living in villages around the southern Appalachian Mountains in parts of eight modern states, one of which, Tennessee, takes its name from one of their villages. Their principal crops were corn, beans, and squash, and the first Europeans to encounter them were amazed at the extent of their farms and neatness of their villages. They were devastated by disease carried by the De Soto expedition in the 1540s, and later smallpox epidemics in the eighteenth century.\n \nThey grew more warlike as trade with Europeans changed their economy and the displacement of other tribes into their lands increased hostility. Then the inevitable encroachment of white settlers from the coast led to the familiar litany of treaties, broken promises, war, and retribution. In an attempt to preserve some of their lands, the Cherokee Nation adopted a constitution modeled after that of the United States, established a boundary with the Americans, developed their own alphabet, published a newspaper, built schools, and established a court system.\n \nWhen gold was discovered on Cherokee lands in 1828 they were doomed. Despite winning two Supreme Court cases upholding their treaties, the federal government under Andrew Jackson refused to enforce the decisions and allowed whites to continue stealing Cherokee property and lands. Eventually the Cherokee gave up and accepted a cash payment to move to the Indian Territory of Oklahoma. The march west, known as the Trail of Tears, was a disaster. After reestablishing themselves and growing somewhat prosperous once more, the majority of the tribe sided with the Confederacy and seceded in 1861. At the Civil War's end, the US government declared all treaties with the Cherokee void. Eventually most of their land in Oklahoma was lost as well, although some attempts at compensation were made in the twentieth century.</string>
    <string _locid="100011">Before European contact, the Comanche were part of the Shoshone tribe living along the Platte River in eastern Wyoming. They acquired the horse in the late seventeenth century and thereafter began migrating to the southwest as a separate tribe. They eventually established effective control over a wide area stretching from western Oklahoma, across the Texas Panhandle, and into New Mexico. This area was known as the Comancheria.\n \nThey became the expert horsemen of the southern plains and were very skilled with the lance, bow, and arrow. Their population grew because hunting buffalo from horseback provided a dependable food supply. They built up huge herds of horses through breeding and capture, and particularly prized the pintos and painted horses. They built a reputation as fierce and pitiless warriors, fighting both as raiders and as defenders of their stock.\n \nFor much of the eighteenth century the Comanche waged war against neighboring tribes, especially the Apaches, and the Spanish based in Santa Fe, Texas, and Mexico. When Americans moved into Texas, the Comanches got into conflict with them. A series of treaties were signed with the Republic of Texas, the United States, and the Confederate States, but the whites could not stop settler encroachment, which always led to more fighting. Gradually the Comanche were devastated by disease and worn down by military action. They were placed on a reservation, but eventually most of that was taken away and opened to white settlers.</string>
    <string _locid="100012">The European's earliest knowledge of the Cree placed them in the woodlands around James Bay in Quebec, where they lived in small family groups. From there the Cree gradually spread westward and eventually the lands they occupied stretched from Quebec across the Great Plains to the mountain ranges near the Pacific Ocean. With the arrival of first the French, and later the British, the Cree became engaged in the fur trade. They traded guns to the Blackfeet for the horses they needed to prosper on the plains.\n \nBy the nineteenth century the Cree had been drastically reduced by disease, especially smallpox, and recurrent wars with other tribes retreating north to escape white settlers pushing up the Missouri River. With the fur trade dropping off and the buffalo disappearing, Cree leaders began working toward creating a safe homeland. They wanted a large native reserve where they could adapt to the European farming lifestyle, yet live according to their own culture, but the government denied their plan. When other tribes tried to fight, the Cree were swept up in the military action and most were settled on small reserves.\n \nMany Cree in the far north escaped forced settlement and maintained their independent life style well into the twentieth century.</string>
    <string _locid="100013">The civilization we now call the Inca appeared as a small tribal group in the southern Peruvian Andes around 1200 CE, possibly migrating from Lake Titicaca. They emphasized community responsibility and mutual aid in the face of recurring wars with neighboring tribes. One of these struggles in the early fifteenth century led to the beginnings of imperial conquest. Two successive strong Incan leaders rapidly expanded their empire, which at its peak stretched over thousands of miles in mountainous terrain, from Ecuador along the Peruvian coast to southern Chile. The empire was spread less by war than by negotiation, alliances, and even bribery. The Inca seem to have been driven by the desire to spread their religious belief in a Sun cult.\n \nThe Inca were remarkable for their system of roads and couriers, and a complex irrigation system that made extensive farming possible in remote locations. Without writing, they did develop a complex counting system that used knots in colored threads called quimpos. Their cities and architecture were astounding, especially the massive stonework of incredible precision, assembled without metal tools.\n \nThe Spanish under Francisco Pizzaro appeared at a time when the Inca had just resolved a civil war between two brothers. The new emperor misjudged the small Spanish force and was captured. He offered a huge ransom of gold and silver, but Pizzaro reneged when the treasure was delivered, and executed his hostage. In a brutal campaign, the core of the Incan Empire was quickly overrun. By 1540, most of Latin America was in Spanish hands. The Inca were largely subjugated and forced to work on Spanish estates.</string>
    <string _locid="100014">The late sixteenth century confederation of five (later six) tribes into the Haudenosaunee League in upstate New York created the most dominant native force in the northeast United States and eastern Canada. At the height of their empire in the late seventeenth century, they held sway over lands stretching from the Chesapeake Bay to the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, and from Kentucky to Ontario. They are remarkable for many achievements, including their political system of checks and balances. The central law of its confederacy was to never war with each other. Against enemies, however, they usually presented a united political and military front .\n \nThe Haudenosaunee population had boomed following the adoption of agriculture in the fourteenth century, and they settled in villages of distinctive wood-framed and bark-covered longhouses. The first Europeans they encountered were the French, fighting against them in support of other tribes along the St. Lawrence. The Haudenosaunee in turn traded for weapons with the Dutch of New Amsterdam. A series of wars followed, mostly over the fur trade. The Haudenosaunee were often in the middle when France and Britain engaged in their periodic wars.\n \nBy the later eighteenth century the Haudenosaunee were being pressured by English settlers moving west from the coast and down the Ohio River Valley. When the American Revolution broke out in 1776, the Haudenosaunee tried to remain neutral, but the league finally splintered and tribes fought on both sides. In 1779 George Washington sent three columns into Haudenosaunee territory, burning forty villages, and driving most of them into Canada. The millions of acres the Haudenosaunee once held in New York were reduced to a few small reservations, which they still hold today.</string>
    <string _locid="100015">The first European reference to the Lakota people places them in modern Minnesota in the seventeenth century. They soon moved farther west away from their enemies the Ojibwa, who may have obtained firearms by trading with Europeans. By the middle eighteenth century they had taken over the northern Great Plains by driving out other tribes. The Lakota became proficient buffalo hunters and prospered, with their population estimated at 30,000 by 1750. They quickly adapted to the use of the horse, and became expert horsemen for both hunting and warfare.\n \nThey fought on the British side during the American Revolution and in the War of 1812, but made a series of friendship treaties with the United States beginning in 1815. A treaty in 1825 confirmed their ownership of a large tract of land stretching from modern Wisconsin to Wyoming, though they later sold the eastern part of it. The tide of white settler encroachment could not be held back, and a recurring pattern of settler invasion, Lakota reprisals, and US military reprisals began in the 1850s.</string>
    <string _locid="100016">The Maya civilization arose in the Yucatan Peninsula of Central America, beginning around 1500 BCE. They were heavily influenced by the Olmec civilization of Mexico, which had developed a system of writing, a calendar, and a complex religion. Population growth was spurred by advances in growing and irrigating crops of corn, beans, squash, and peppers.\n \nThe period from 300 to 900 CE is known as the Classic Period of the Maya culture, which featured the construction of very impressive cities, advanced writing, astronomy, arithmetic, a complex political system of competing city states, and the Maya ball game pok-a-tok. They were able to measure very precisely the orbits of planets. They went through cycles of building, tearing down, and rebuilding on the foundations of the past. Although their remaining structures are of bare stone today, they were apparently once painted in very bright colors.\n \nBeginning in 750 CE the Maya civilization went into decline for reasons not clear today. One opinion is that the population had expanded during a period of good climate, and trees had been widely removed to farm increasingly marginal land. Ecological changes led to massive crop failures, starvation, and war over decreasing food resources. By 830 construction had ceased and the cities were gradually abandoned. The Maya moved to smaller agricultural villages, and their great cities disappeared into the enveloping tropical forests.</string>
    <string _locid="100017">The native peoples inhabiting part of the coast of Vancouver Island were called the Nootka by Captain James Cook when he explored this area in the 1778. The name has come to represent several native groups in the area who speak a similar language, although it was not a name they used themselves. They inhabited a rugged coast backed by mountains. The area was plentiful in seafood (whales, sea lions, seals, halibut, salmon, and shellfish) and land wildlife (deer, elk, and bear). They often moved to temporary bases in summer or at other times to take advantage of seasonal food resources.\n \nRed cedar wood was a critical resource because of its strength and resistance to rot. It was used for large dugout canoes and for construction of plank houses. Cedar roots and bark were crafted into hats, ropes, mats, and clothes. Everything they made was a work of art, decorated with designs and animal depictions from their stories and myths.\n \nIn 1785 Europeans and Americans began coming to the area for sea otter furs, which peaked at a price of $4,000 per pelt. The fur trade lasted barely 20 years, until the otter was extinct along the coast, but new white settlers were coming for other resources.</string>
    <string _locid="100018">The name "Seminole" derives from the Spanish word for "wild men." They were originally part of the Creek tribe in Georgia, but migrated to Florida in the eighteenth century. They sought to live in territory only loosely claimed by Spain, and tried to stay out of the path of the expanding British colonies. North Florida was also a refuge for escaped slaves, who allied with the Seminoles. British colonists, and later Americans, began encroaching into Florida seeking land and chasing escaped slaves, especially after Florida became part of the US in 1819. Small clashes erupted into the first of three wars with the United States in 1817. The Seminoles proved very tough opponents, easily slipping back into the swamps and laying careful ambushes.\n \nFuture president Andrew Jackson led an invasion of Florida that eventually defeated most of the tribe in the first war. Attempts to move the Seminoles to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in the 1830s caused a second war to break out. It dragged on at great expense and military loss to the US, but ended with most of the Seminoles being moved west. Perhaps 500 Seminoles remained in Florida in a reserve around Lake Okeechobee. These few survivors got into a third war of mostly guerrilla action that lasted from 1855-1858.\n \nThe Florida Seminoles were eventually granted several reservations near Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades.</string>
    <string _locid="100019">When the Portuguese, French, and Dutch penetrated the interior of Brazil they encountered a number of warlike and aggressive tribes called the Tupi. The coastal Tupi lived mainly by agriculture, growing manioc, yams, tobacco, beans, squash, peppers, and other crops in forest clearings. When the soils were depleted, they would move to a new location, clear the trees, and replant.\n \nIn the sixteenth century they became embroiled in the wars between Europeans fighting in Brazil, mainly the French and Portuguese, who both employed native allies. Many of the Tupi were forced to work on the plantations, but they fared poorly and died. They suffered from epidemics that swept through their villages, and were forcibly taken from their villages to be sold as slaves, often by enemy tribes. European encroachment spread as the trees were cleared, and sugar plantations were established. Devastated by the recurring wars, disease, and slavery, the remaining Tupi withdrew up the Amazon into interior lands the Europeans did not want.</string>
    <string _locid="100020">The European empires in the New World lasted in most cases for a little more than 300 years. By the early nineteenth century most European colonies had thrown off their Old World masters and had become independent nations. All that remained of the great Old World empires were Britain's colony in Canada and a scattering of island colonies in the Caribbean Sea.\n \nThe first revolution by the Thirteen British colonies resulted in the eventual formation of the United States. These colonists were chafing under rule by the Parliament in Britain with no American representation. They felt handicapped by British prohibitions on expanding west into Native American territories, and they disliked laws that gave advantages to British traders and shippers at the colonists' expense. When revolution broke out, the British were unable to win the war militarily, and made peace when France, Spain, and the Netherlands sided with the colonists.\n \nThe French occupation of Spain and Portugal in the early nineteenth century cut off those countries from their colonies in South America and set off the wars of independence. The success of these revolutions was assured when the United States stated its Monroe Doctrine, forbidding any power from further conquests or colony placement in the Americas, and Great Britain made it clear that its navy would not allow such actions either.</string>
    <string _locid="100021">Warfare during the age of Napoleon was defined by several parameters: the effective range of a smoothbore musket (50-100 yards); the effective range of cannon balls (1,000 yards); the speed of marching men and charging horses; the morale, discipline, and training of men required to stand in lines or march in columns under fire; and the ability of commanders to inspire troops and deploy them effectively.\n \nThe basic problem was how to take a position held by the enemy and the basic answer was to march at them in a dense column of infantry carrying muskets fitted with bayonets. If the column had the will and strength to march up to the enemy and keep coming, the defender would normally break and withdraw, conceding victory. Cannons fired iron balls at both defenders and marching columns, attempting to weaken morale before the moment of contact. Infantry in defensive lines fired volleys at the columns to kill officers and men, and weaken the attacker's morale. Skirmishers out front of both sides tried to do the same. Cavalry hovered on the wings to charge in against disorganized troops and ride them down.\n \nFor most of the Napoleonic era France did everything better than its opponents. Its cannon were the best served; its infantry had the best morale and marched faster, and its columns were rarely stopped; its cavalry was the most audacious; and its leaders were the most effective in battlefield maneuvers. By 1813, however, the other European powers had learned a great deal, had found competent leaders of their own, and had a manpower advantage that was wearing down the French. At Waterloo in 1815, British lines of volley firing infantry stopped the French massed columns while the Prussian columns hit the French flank; together they brought the Napoleonic era to an end.</string>
    <string _locid="100022">The discovery of the New World was made possible by advances in sailing and ship technology. Some the more critical advances were the arrival of the compass from Asia, the astrolabe, which allowed sailors to calculate their latitude or position between the two poles, the caravel ship design, and the lateen sail, which made it possible to sail almost into the wind. With these technologies, the Portuguese were able to begin working their way south along the coast of Africa and eventually around it to India. Columbus relied on these same technologies to get across the Atlantic to the New World.\n \nOcean voyages in this age were very dangerous. Although ship technology had made great advancement, ships were still small and vulnerable in heavy seas. Supplies of dried and salted foods were limited and liable to spoilage, as were fresh water supplies. There was no understanding at the time of what caused scurvy; any voyage of several months or more risked much of the crew getting ill or dying. Sailors of the age had no way to calculate their longitude (their position east-west around the Earth), and relied on dead reckoning for several hundred more years.\n \nVoyages of exploration were inherently dangerous because they went into uncharted waters. Reefs and hidden rocks could wreck a ship on an unknown coast with no chance of rescue. The annals of the age are filled with records of ships lost and explorers who disappeared with no trace. The explorers of this age were intrepid men who faced great hardship and danger in their quest for glory and wealth.</string>
    <string _locid="100023">From the late 1500s into the 1700s, the Caribbean Sea was a hunting ground for sea pirates that preyed on ships of Spain at first, but later of all nations with colonies and trading outposts in the area. The vast treasures of gold and silver, and other wealth that Spain began shipping back from the New World first caught the attention of these pirates. Many were officially sanctioned by nations at war with Spain, but during an era of slow communication and no effective international policing, the line between official and criminal piracy was indistinct.\n \nPirate crews came from all walks of life, but most were seaman who wanted a chance at real freedom and wealth. Many were escaped slaves or servants with nothing to go home to. Crews were usually very democratic, with the captain elected by the crew and subject to removal at any time. They preferred small, fast ships that could fight or flee as the occasion warranted. Their preferred method of attack was to board and fight hand-to-hand. They preyed on lightly armed merchant ships, but would occasionally attack a city or large warship if the stakes were high enough. They usually lacked any sort of discipline, drank heavily, and most ended up dead at sea or on a gallows after a short but wild career.\n \nAt their peak, pirates controlled island towns that were havens for recruiting crews, selling captured merchandise, refitting ships, and spending their loot. Various nations turned a blind eye to piracy, so long as their own ships were not being taken. As the Caribbean became more settled and more economically important, pirates gradually disappeared as they were hunted down by warships and their bases were taken.</string>
    <string _locid="100024">Although North America was largely ignored by Europeans for a hundred years after its discovery, the area around Newfoundland was visited regularly by fishermen. These men often traded with natives, and the furs they brought back attracted a new sort of entrepreneur, the fur trader. Ships from France, Spain, England, and the Netherlands cruised the coast looking for native hunters willing to trade furs for knives and other goods. The French tried to monopolize the northern trade by placing outposts along the St. Lawrence River to intercept natives coming from the interior. The Dutch placed outposts at New Amsterdam and Albany on the Hudson for the same purpose. A beaver fur that could be obtained for a few tools or trinkets might sell for huge profits in Europe.\n \nThe demand for fur created intense rivalries on both the European and native sides. Wars were fought for control of the coasts, while native tribes fought over trapping grounds and the role of middlemen with the Europeans. As beaver populations were completely extinguished nearer to the coasts, the traders and trappers had to push further inland. The French placed trading forts along the Great Lakes and eventually down the Mississippi River. The fur trade moved all the way to the Pacific Coast up rivers like the Missouri, and the Russians also sought sea otter furs.\n \nThe quest for furs was the critical factor in the early exploration and settlement of North America, but the industry had a limited era of dominance. As colonies expanded in North America, changes in European tastes for hats, the growing scarcity of easily obtainable furs, and rising demand for other important resources (such as farmland, timber, and minerals) reduced the fur trade to a shadow of its former prominence.</string>
    <string _locid="100025">Gold was discovered in 1848 at Sutter's Mill, near Sacramento, California. Far from a celebration, the discovery proved a disaster for John Sutter, who was more interested in cultivating his land. Once the word got out, waves of eager prospectors came overland and by sea. Ships were abandoned in California ports as crews joined the rush. Many who made the trip were unprepared and some entrepreneurs became rich selling necessities along the westward trail or in the gold camps.\n \nMost gold prospectors never became rich, barely finding enough gold to pay for their daily living expenses. Collectively, they were known as the 49ers. When the 49ers departed, they left behind a changed California. Mining companies owned and operated most of the productive mines. San Francisco, which had been a small port town, became a large, prosperous city. Prospectors traveled from boom town to boom town in their quest to strike it rich. The California Gold Rush was followed by similar gold strikes in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, the Yukon, and Alaska.</string>
    <string _locid="100026">The second great human economic transformation after the rise of agriculture was the Industrial Revolution, which was basically the gradual conversion of handmade craftsman manufacturing to machine-made mass production. Industrial production required the grouping of labor, the creation of machines to do the work, and the availability of power sources to run the machines. These elements and several other factors came together first in Great Britain in the late eighteenth century, and then spread to the rest of Europe, North America, and eventually most of the world.\n \nHistorians generally point to the development of the steam engine as the spark that ignited the Industrial Revolution. This basic machine, powered by coal, could be placed anywhere and drive other machines, particularly at first powered looms for weaving. Very quickly the steam engine moved into other industries and then into transportation, where it increased the speed and efficiency of railroads, steamships, and communication.\n \nThe economic and social effects of industrialization were enormous, including rapid population growth due to increased efficiency in food production; capitalism as industry created profits but required great investment; social conflict between workers and industry owners; political change as democracy, socialism, and communism arose; scientific advance such as electricity and medicines, and increased lethality of war as conscription of mass armies and technologically advanced weapons took their toll.</string>
    <string _locid="100027">Part of the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation was a series of wars that attempted to abolish Protestantism and restore the Catholic Church's predominance. The most vicious of these was the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), fought mainly in Germany. While religious issues were the direct cause of the conflict, it evolved into a larger political struggle in which France and Sweden sought to reduce the strength of the Habsburg dynasty that ruled Austria. Eventually most of Europe was involved and Austria was forced into peace, while France and her allies threatened to take Prague, Munich, and Vienna.\n \nModern estimates are that the population of Germany declined by 20% during the Thirty Years War; in some regions the decline was 50% as entire villages disappeared. Long-term effects of the war were the establishment of Switzerland and the Dutch Republic, the emergence of France as the dominant land power of Europe, and the continued fractionalization of Germany that long delayed its unification into a state.</string>
    <string _locid="100028">Elizabeth I was born in 1533, and was the last ruler of the famed Tudor dynasty. For much of her childhood she lived in exile from her ill-tempered father Henry VIII, who had her mother executed on false charges of witchcraft and treason. Henry VIII went on to marry and kill many other wives until his last wife, Catherine Parr, convinced him to reconcile with his daughters.\n \nElizabeth's reign was marked by great achievements in writing, navigation, and philosophy by individuals such as William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon. Elizabeth herself was a talented poet and a tremendous patron of the arts.\n \nDuring her reign, there was much religious unrest in Britain; her leadership was key in avoiding civil war. Despite the threat of a Spanish invasion, Britain remained secure during Elizabeth's reign. Unlike her notorious father, Elizabeth never married and had no children; she died in 1603.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Elizabeth is aristocratic and aloof. You will find her to be a reliable ally who understands the importance of a strong economy. Under her direction, the English navy was second to none. Elizabeth has a deep distrust of the French, but has a fondness for the Dutch.</string>
    <string _locid="100029">Maurice of Orange, also known as Maurice of Nassau, was born in 1567. He became Prince of Orange in 1618.\n \nDuring Maurice's reign the Netherlands were fighting for independence from Spain. Until Maurice took control, the revolt against the Spaniards was disorganized. He organized the troops and won several important victories that led to a 12-year truce, which ended in 1621. His attempts to deal with Spain after the truce ended were not successful.\n \nMaurice never married and was succeeded by his brother. He lived an extravagant life and was a great admirer of horses. He referred to them as his 'favorite courtiers'. Whether that was an indictment of his human courtiers or an elevation of a prized animal is uncertain.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Maurice is noble in bearing, refined, and confident. After his difficulties with the Spanish during his reign, he may be hesitant to want to help them.</string>
    <string _locid="100030">Napoleon was born in 1769 to a well-to-do Corsican family. His native language was Italian and an Italian accent flavored his French. Contrary to popular misconception, Napoleon was not short by the standards of the era. In fact, he was slightly taller than most men of his time at about 5 feet 7 inches.\n \nNapoleon was not always a successful student, but he had a tremendous ability to understand and memorize military information. He made good use of his outstanding memory and became known as one of the most brilliant military strategists of all time; at one point he controlled almost all of Central and Western Europe.\n \nDespite his military brilliance, Napoleon is almost as well known for his spectacular military mistakes. At Waterloo he made several tactical errors, including making movements without notifying his allies, that led to his ultimate defeat.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, you can expect to see Napoleon's ambitious nature reflected in how he plays. He is a great military strategist who prefers to play offensively rather than defensively. Napoleon is not friendly with the British and may hesitate to cooperate with them. He likes to be in control and does not appreciate direction from anyone else.</string>
    <string _locid="100031">Frederick the Great was born in 1712. He was known as a lover of music, art, and French literature. Unfortunately for Frederick, his father did not share his love of the arts. The king tried to mold Frederick into an image of himself, a great military leader. When Frederick rebelled against this upbringing he was branded a traitor, imprisoned, threatened with execution, and forced to watch the beheading of his friend, Hans Hermann von Katte.\n \nFrederick's father was not entirely unsuccessful with his son. Although Frederick never relinquished his love of the arts, he did become a great military leader who led the Prussian forces successfully through three wars.\n \nHe was a great tactician who had a knack for keeping opposition forces from uniting against him.\n \nWhile pursuing his interests in writing and warfare, Frederick also managed to make Prussia into an economic powerhouse. With such a wide range of successes both on and off the battlefield, it is no wonder that Frederick was nicknamed "the Great."\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Frederick is as confident and charismatic as he was in life. He prefers small forces to large armies and likes to catch his enemies off guard.</string>
    <string _locid="100032">Suleiman I was born in 1494. He ruled during the height of the Ottoman Empire, and his reign lasted a remarkable 46 years.\n \nSuleiman was an accomplished poet and even a goldsmith. He is renowned for his military feats. He was a conqueror who greatly expanded the Ottoman Empire until it became foremost in the world both politically and militarily. One of his few defeats happened at the hands of the Knights of St. John during the Siege of Malta.\n \n"Suleiman the Magnificent" is the European name for Suleiman, reflecting their awe at his military achievements. The Ottomans called him Suleiman the Lawgiver because he had a major role in restructuring Ottoman Law. Suleiman was known for valuing fairness.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Suleiman is proud, decisive, and independent. He has a love of artillery and large armies. When he attacks, he likes to bring every resource to battle; he is not likely to leave anything in reserve.</string>
    <string _locid="100033">Henry the Navigator, or Infante Dom Henrique, as he was known in his native Portugal, was born in 1394 and died in 1460. He was a prince of Portugal, but perhaps his most important title was that of governor of the Order of Christ, which was a successor to the Knights Templar. The Order of Christ controlled vast resources, which helped to fund Prince Henry's real passion: exploration.\n \nPrince Henry is rightly credited with inspiring the sense of adventure that led to the European era of exploration and discovery. Henry surrounded himself with expert cartographers and navigators. In addition, he was instrumental in the development of a new type of ship, the caravel. Without it, Columbus would have been hard pressed to sail to the Americas.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Henry is mostly agreeable, calm, and far-sighted. He favors economic expansion over military force and understands the value of trade. Henry is a generous and cooperative ally.</string>
    <string _locid="100034">Ivan IV was born in 1530 and was the first leader of Russia to take the title Tsar. Despite Ivan's sometimes bloodthirsty acts the "Terrible" in his name is not reflective of meanness or evil, but conveyed that he was "formidable."\n \nIndeed he was! He was outrageously wealthy and created laws that virtually enslaved the peasant class in Russia. He was known for acts of cruelty, including the slaughter of up to 40,000 non-military inhabitants of Novgorod and the accidental killing of his own son during an argument.\n \nBecause of the outrageousness of these acts some of Ivan's accomplishments are overlooked. During his early reign he was known as a reforming leader who created a standing army and revised the law code. It was only after the death of his wife that Ivan became progressively less balanced and more ruthless.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition Ivan is in his later years. You can expect him to be sinister, taunting and threatening. Ivan loves large armies even at the expense of technological advancement. He is especially fond of infantry units.</string>
    <string _locid="100035">Isabella was born in 1451 and died in 1504. She came from a long line of European royalty including Henry IV of England. She and her husband, Ferdinand of Aragon, are best known as the patrons of Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World.\n \nAfter Columbus' discovery, Isabella took a keen interest in the welfare of the Native Americans. She ordered that those brought to Spain should be returned to their homes, and she made provisions in her will that Native Americans be well-treated in Spanish-held territories. Unfortunately, the wishes in her will were not always honored.\n \nHer legacy has a darker side: she established the Spanish Inquisition and was responsible for expelling the Jews from Spain in 1492.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, you will find Isabella to be a mostly charming opponent or ally. She's witty and engaging with a sense of adventure.</string>
    <string _locid="100036">The Abus Gunner is an unique Ottoman infantry unit that sacrifices hit points for a high attack. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Artillery Foundry. Abus Gunners, like the Ottoman Humbaracis, inflict siege damage with their ranged attack, making them comparable to artillery.</string>
    <string _locid="100037">Abus guns are a short-barreled artillery piece that fired shot about the size of a fist. Ottoman artillery did not seem to conform to any known standards, and their artillery pieces varied widely, from large siege bombards to small Abus Guns light enough to travel with soldiers on the move, rather than sitting in guarded artillery emplacements. Abus Guns are roughly analagous to Falconets, but are considered howitzers because of the low velocity of their projectiles.</string>
    <string _locid="100038">The Culverin is an artillery piece with long range, good damage and accuracy, but limited area of effect damage. Culverin outrange most units in the game and are a good choice to field against other artillery.</string>
    <string _locid="100039">The Culverin gets its name from the Latin word for serpent - colubra - used to describe the cannon's distinctive curving handles. It was a long, heavy cannon and could fire at great range. A skilled team of gunners could use the Culverin's extreme range and precision to target specific enemy buildings or defenses.</string>
    <string _locid="100040">The Falconet is an early artillery piece. Like most artillery pieces it has a long range and does a lot of damage, even damaging nearby units and buildings with area of effect damage. It is trained from the Artillery Foundry or may be sent from the Home City. Like all artillery pieces, it is expensive and takes up several population slots.\n \nFalconets are the first true artillery pieces you can generally expect to see in most games. Grenadiers are available earlier, but are often quickly eclipsed by the more powerful, longer-ranged Falconet. Only the Ottomans or Portuguese can field other artillery early.</string>
    <string _locid="100041">Falconets were among the smallest artillery. They weighed about 280 pounds, had a six-foot barrel and used about a pound of powder to fire a one pound shot. Still, the small quantity of powder (relative to larger artillery pieces) was enough to make a properly braced Falconet fly back up to 10 yards when fired.</string>
    <string _locid="100042">The Great Bombard is a unique Ottoman artillery piece with a massive attack, big range, and lots of hitpoints. It takes up a lot of population slots -- and with good reason. The Great Bombard can reduce buildings to rubble in just a few volleys. Like the Heavy Cannon, the Bombard can be produced from the Factory or shipped from the Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="100043">Great bombards were a set of medieval cannons that were cast of bronze or iron and fired stone projectiles weighing hundreds of pounds. The greatest of these was a cannon called 'Basilica' that pounded the walls of Constantinople. It was over 25 feet long, used hundreds of pounds of powder that, with a projectile weighing in excess of 1,200 pounds, took hours to load. The bombard was so huge that it had to be constructed in two pieces that screwed together to make it, presumably, easier to move. This meant it only took 60 oxen and hundreds of men over 40 days to move the bombard the 120 miles between Adrianople and Constantinople at an achingly slow two miles a day!</string>
    <string _locid="100044">The Grenadier is a heavy ranged infantry unit that throws grenades, which inflict siege damage in an area. It is already available in the Commerce Age at the Artillery Foundry and operates like a short-ranged artillery unit. They are effective against buildings and infantry formations, but are vulnerable to cavalry. Grenadiers are more costly than regular infantry units, but possess high resistance against ranged attacks and many hit points to withstand musket fire. Grenadiers are a little faster than proper artillery, but have less range and damage. All European civilizations can equip Grenadiers with hand mortars with greater range by sending the Grenade Launchers card.</string>
    <string _locid="100045">Grenadiers began as a unit of siege infantry that hurled grenades - iron spheres filled with gunpowder -- at their targets. Grenadiers needed to be tall, strong men so they could lob the grenades to their targets, or at least far enough away so that the explosion didn't damage their own troops. Over time, tactics and technology changed, and Grenadiers evolved into elite, highly trained and storied infantry regiments.\n \nGrenadiers wore long-tailed coats festooned with buttons, braid, and brass. The classic Grenadier wears a tall, cylindrical hat trimmed in or covered with bearskin. The hat originally had no brim, or a very little one at most, so it would not interfere with throwing, even though later Grenadiers fought as traditional infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="100046">The Heavy Cannon is a long-ranged artillery piece that does a lot of area-of-effect damage. It is slow like other cannon and vulnerable once units can get close enough to attack it.\n \nThe Heavy Cannon is only available from the Factory or the Home City. It cannot be conventionally trained like other military. British and Ottomans lack the Heavy Cannon, but have unique artillery instead.</string>
    <string _locid="100047">The logistics of moving, maintaining, positioning, aiming, and firing artillery required a highly drilled and disciplined team with a sharp commander. In addition to the men and artillery pieces in his command, an artillery officer had to see to the horses used to haul the pieces around - sometimes up to six for heavier guns. When one side in a battle could field hundreds of artillery pieces, the logistics of just moving them into position were taxing. "Heavy Cannon" is a relative term, but in general, cannon considered 'heavy' were typically used as permanent gun emplacements to defend Forts and strategic locations.</string>
    <string _locid="100048">The Mortar is a specialized artillery piece used to damage buildings or ships. Like most artillery it has a good range and high attack, though it does little damage to units. It is trained from the Artillery Foundry, or may be sent from the Home City. Like all artillery, it is expensive and takes up several population slots.\n \nMortars are what a player uses to take a town apart. Mortars are often set up behind a rank of more general purpose artillery. Because they are not effective against units, it is even more important to protect them from units that get close.</string>
    <string _locid="100049">A mortar is an artillery piece with a short barrel and a large bore that fires massive projectiles in a high arc. The name "mortar" probably refers to its resemblance to the mortar of a mortar and pestle. The high arc of a mortar's fire reaches emplacements and buildings that are screened by terrain or walls or other permanent defenses. The projectile a mortar fired was filled with gunpowder and fitted with a fuse that was lit right before firing the mortar. The artillery crew had to carefully measure how long to make the fuse for the mortar to explode at the right moment (usually on impact). This made mortars much better at firing on buildings and fortifications than on fluid groups of moving troops.</string>
    <string _locid="100050">The Organ Gun is a Portuguese artillery piece focused on damaging units. It has less range than most artillery pieces, but is devastating to soldiers, especially infantry. It is trained from the Artillery Foundry in the Fortress Age, or can be sent from the Home City. Like all artillery pieces, it is expensive and takes up several population spaces.\n \nOrgan Guns are what a Portuguese player uses to shred enemy units. Because of their limited range and low hitpoints, it is important to protect them from units that get close.</string>
    <string _locid="100051">Also called a ribauldequin, this Renaissance-era gun's multiple iron barrels line up side by side. These small caliber (for artillery) projectiles were meant to be fired at the same time, creating a wave of fearsome iron that could tear ranks of enemy foot and cavalry soldiers apart.</string>
    <string _locid="100052">The Rocket is a unique British artillery piece that has a long range and does a lot of damage. It is produced from the Factory, or can be sent from the Home City. Like all artillery pieces, it is expensive and takes up several population spaces.</string>
    <string _locid="100053">The first rockets used in warfare were developed by the Chinese and Indians. The principle is not dissimilar to a bottle rocket, where explosive propellant (gunpowder) propels a missile (the rocket) and is stabilized by a stick that extends well beyond the body of the rocket. It was William Congreve, a British officer, who developed their use for warfare in the Napoleonic era. His rockets were tubes capped by cones and filled with gunpowder and either shrapnel or shot. They were fired from structures that consisted of a ladder with supports for the body of the rocket and a frame to prop up both ladder and rocket. These were tall affairs, and needed to be, when the stick of a large rocket could be as long as 15 feet! The "rockets' red glare" in the Star-Spangled Banner, the national anthem of the US, refers to the rockets used by the British navy in their assault on Fort McHenry in 1814.</string>
    <string _locid="100054">Cavalry Archers are a fast, ranged unit. They are effective at raiding and chasing down enemy cavalry. Their range is short, and they are vulnerable to longer ranged units.\n \nOnly the Ottomans and Russians field Cavalry Archers. They have fewer hitpoints and a lower attack than Dragoons, but are cheaper to train and cost less population space.</string>
    <string _locid="100055">Nomadic cavalry archers roamed with their herds in eastern and southern Russia. They raided, traveled, and conquered into what would become Russia and eastern Europe. The Europeans called these fierce cavalrymen the Tartars, though the Tartars were only one of a conglomeration of many distinct nomadic tribes and people. Their colorful tents earned them a more poetic name, the "Golden Horde." The Golden Horde, united under Tokhtamysh, sacked Moscow, but was soon wracked by a civil war that splintered the Horde into several Khanates. The new Russian nation of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, allied with some of the splinter groups, while the Ottoman Empire under Mehmed II allied with others.\n \nCavalry Archers wore light clothes - baggy pants, vests, long coats, and furred hats. Blue and red were popular colors, and embroidery a popular decoration to garments. Soldiers carried a variety of arms, primarily bows, but also swords, spears, and later, firearms. Though the Tartars are most commonly thought of as cavalry, they were competent infantry as well.</string>
    <string _locid="100056">Cossacks are a unique Russian cavalry unit with good speed and decent hitpoints, but no range. A Cossack does all of his damage in melee combat. They are similar to but weaker than the Hussars of other nations, and a solid cavalry unit that is good at raiding, assaulting artillery, and fleeing a losing battle.\n \nWhen training Cossacks, it is a good idea to train a complementary unit, preferably one with range, that can soften up the enemy units before the Cossacks get close.</string>
    <string _locid="100057">The Cossacks fled a life of poverty and serfdom in Moscow to settle as a free people on the frontiers of Imperial Russia, where they became legendary and feared horsemen. Every man rode and fought; the Cossacks did not have an army, they were an army. The Russian government understood the value of having these very territorial, independent warriors as a buffer to invasion and established an alliance with them, giving the Cossacks land and property.\n \nThe Cossacks wore furred caps, long overcoats, loose trousers, and tall boots. They carried lances, sabers, short pikes, and muskets.</string>
    <string _locid="100058">Cuirassiers are a unique French cavalry unit with no range, high hitpoints, and a massive attack that includes area damage. Cuirassiers are the heaviest cavalry in the game, take up a lot of population space, and are quite expensive. As cavalry they are rather slow, but they are still faster than infantry and pack more power into a single unit.\n \nCuirassiers are expensive to train and painful to lose. It is a good idea to group Cuirassiers with a unit like the Skirmisher, which is effective against infantry that can threaten even the powerful Cuirassier.</string>
    <string _locid="100059">Several nations fielded these heavy cavalry units in differing numbers and armaments. Early cuirassiers resembled medieval knights, but eventually only wore a breastplate and backplate for armor. In time, cuirassiers evolved into other cavalry such as hussars, dragoons, and lancers. The breastplate, or cuirass, gave these mounted soldiers their name. Napoleon favored cuirassiers and had over dozen regiments of them. They were used to crash into the ranks of enemy soldiers, hacking and stabbing their way through lines of infantry and more poorly armed and armored cavalry.\n \nHorses and men both had to be big to carry the weight of their namesake armor, and these big men and their imposing mounts were given the nickname "big brothers." They carried straight-bladed swords that killed with stabbing thrusts and primitive pistols with a range and rate of fire that was so poor the cuirassiers might have been just as well off without them.</string>
    <string _locid="100060">Dragoons are a fast, ranged unit. They are effective at raiding and chasing down enemy cavalry. Their range is short, and they can be vulnerable to longer ranged soldiers.\n \nDragoons have a good measure of everything that make a unit effective: speed, some range, and hitpoints. Sure, they cost more population space than infantry, but infantry can't catch them.</string>
    <string _locid="100061">Dragoons were a very flexible mounted infantry, using their horses to move swiftly, then often dismounting to fight on foot with carbines, pistols, and sabers. During the eighteenth century in Europe, military leaders maintained dozens of regiments of Dragoons, placing them in a fixed role as medium cavalry. In the Americas, Dragoons were used as both cavalry and infantry. They scouted, raided camps, screened armies, and protected the rear of retreats.\n \nDragoons wore tall helmets, often plumed, and carried a variety of arms. The carbines they used, called "dragons," gave the Dragoons their name. This short-barreled, smoothbore weapon had less range and power than a rifle and required that Dragoons be accompanied by infantrymen or dismounted Dragoons armed with longer-range firearms.</string>
    <string _locid="100062">The Hussar is a fast cavalry unit with good speed and attack, but no range. This means the Hussar is vulnerable to units until it can close with them. As one of the faster units in the game - this happens quickly.\n \nHussars, for the civilizations that get them, are a good backbone for a cavalry-driven army. They are good at assaulting artillery, going toe-to-toe with other cavalry, and fleeing battle when high-hitpoint, high-attack units like Pikemen appear.</string>
    <string _locid="100063">Lasalle, Napoleon's most dashing and competent light cavalry commander, boldly stated that any Hussar who lived to see the age of 30 was "a blackguard." Hussars were known for their daring and flamboyant displays in and out of combat. They could be an unruly and rowdy lot, though some, like the Prussian Death's Head Hussars, looked quite severe. Hussars were used to scout, gather intelligence, run down their enemy counterparts, and in flanking and screening maneuvers. They were excellent horsemen and daring to a fault.\n \nThe Prussian hussars, who served under Wellington at Waterloo, wore uniforms of almost entirely unrelieved black, with a large white skull and crossbones on the front of their short-brimmed, tall cylindrical hats. Hussars were typically armed with curved cavalry sabers and sometimes muskets or pistols.</string>
    <string _locid="100064">Lancers are a unique Spanish cavalry unit with a good attack, good resistance, and good hitpoints, but no range. Like most melee units, this means that Lancers are vulnerable to ranged attacks until they can get close enough to their targets to attack.\n \nLancers are very good against infantry, in contrast to most cavalry, who should flee infantry in general. They will still take damage as they run in close to ranged enemy units, but if those units are infantry there had better be a lot of them.</string>
    <string _locid="100065">Lancers were about the only cavalry that ranks of musketeers with bayonets couldn't drop. Their lances gave them better range than bayonets though they were already an archaic weapon. Though it never vanished entirely from battlefields, the Polish were responsible for the lance's rise to prominence in the nineteenth century.\n \nLances were wooden shafts that varied from nine feet to over 15 feet long. They carried swallow-tailed banners just under the metal tips. Some Cossacks carried lances, and many dragoon regiments were armed with both lances and carbines.</string>
    <string _locid="100066">Oprichniks are a unique Russian melee cavalry unit with decent speed, good hitpoints and attack, especially against Settlers and buildings.\n \nThe Oprichniks really shine when half a dozen or so are sent on raiding attacks to harass enemy Settlers or destroy early Houses and resource buildings. Because of their mobility, Oprichniks can also be a good alternative, or supplement to artillery.</string>
    <string _locid="100067">Oprichniks were the police and soldiers of Oprichnina, a royal domain created by Ivan the Terrible. Tsar Ivan used his Oprichniks to crush any hereditary opposition to his rule. These soldiers carried out their Tsar's will with unflinching loyalty and were brutal and ferocious thugs.\n \nThe Tsar's goals were not especially original, but Ivan the Terrible and his Oprichniks operated on an unprecedented scale. One attack on the city of Novgorod took the lives of at least 3,000 people. They were slaughtered over the course of a week. Some accounts put the death toll as high as 60,000 people.\n \nThe Oprichniks promoted a fierce appearance, wearing all black uniforms and riding black horses. The Oprichnik seal bore a dog, symbolizing their loyalty to the Tsar and their tenacity in fighting for the Tsar, and a broom, to represent sweeping away the Tsar's enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="100068">Ruyters are a unique Dutch cavalry unit with short range, and good hitpoints and attack. They cost only a single population slot, so they are a good value for their speed as cavalry.\n \nAs a ranged cavalry unit, Ruyters are good at chasing down and peppering enemy cavalry with fire before retreating from melee combat, which is not their forte.</string>
    <string _locid="100069">Ruyters were a light cavalry who used pistols as their primary weapon. These soldiers were known as "Riders," and often carried several pistols with them - even having aids or servants whose job it was to carry extra pistols - because they wouldn't have time to reload the weapons when in range. Short-range fire with pistols was often deadly, but even shots that were not immediately lethal usually killed due to infection or disease because of the state of medicine at the time. Ruyters were able to fire their relatively small arms while on the move and this mobility made them fierce combatants.\n \nRuyters wore light armor and carried several sets of pistols. They were known to carry sabers and axes as sidearms for use when their complement of loaded pistols had been spent.</string>
    <string _locid="100070">The Sipahis are a unique Ottoman cavalry unit with good speed, excellent hitpoints, and no range. Since they do their damage in melee combat, Sipahis rely on their speed and hitpoints to get close enough to do damage.\n \nSipahis can only be sent from the Home City, and you can only have a limited number of them at one time.</string>
    <string _locid="100071">The Sipahis were cavalry for two different nations. Their name derives from a Persian word for soldier, "sipahi." They were elite cavalry in the Ottoman army, performing much the same duties as the janissaries, only mounted. There were more Sipahi than any other cavalry in the Ottoman army. They were also Algerian cavalrymen that fought for the French in Africa. These cavalrymen revolted when the French wanted them to leave Africa to aid France in the Franco-Prussian wars.\n \nMounted soldiers, they wore baggy pants and riding boots. Long, heavy cloaks, turned out to show the lining, draped them shoulder to calf, and they covered their heads with turbans. Armed chiefly with swords, they also carried firearms and spears.</string>
    <string _locid="100072">Uhlans are a unique German cavalry unit with good speed who sacrifice higher hitpoints for a good attack, but have no range. Like most melee cavalry they rely on their speed to get close to enemy units or to flee battles they don't want to fight.\n \nUhlans arrive with every Shipment from the Home City beyond the first Age, so expect a German player to have at least some military units early to defend their colony or rush enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="100073">Uhlans grew out of Polish light cavalry used by the Prussians and from the Tartars that settled in Lithuania after their defeat by Tamerlane. These Tartars were - like their forefathers - an elite mounted cavalry. In the nineteenth century, Prussian cavalry from Poland were called uhlans, and before long light cavalry in general were referred to as uhlans.\n \nUhlans wore a distinctive four-cornered hat, the czapka, which was tall and sometimes decorated with plumes, and a jacket called an ulanka. They were armed with lances, sabers and, later, pistols.</string>
    <string _locid="100074">War Wagons are a unique German cavalry unit that has great hitpoints, a good ranged attack, and good speed. There is little reason not to build them if you have the resources.\n \nA war wagon excels at fighting cavalry because they have enough hitpoints to withstand melee attacks, enough speed to catch - or at least chase - cavalry that flee, and enough of an attack to do damage when they get into range.</string>
    <string _locid="100075">These fortified carts were used to great effect by the infantry armies of the Hussites, followers of the Czech religious reformer John Huss (Jan Hus), who was excommunicated and burned at the stake early in the fifteenth century. John Zizka lead the Hussite forces against the armies of Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund. His army was largely comprised of peasants, and Zizka developed new tactics to suit the farm-grown sensibilites of his untrained soldiers. They armored farm wagons, used flails and pitchforks, and a number of howitzer artillery pieces. The armored wagons moved in trains and would circle up, forming an overlapping impromptu fortress from which they would fire their artillery baiting opposing armies into a response. The wagons could also be used in offense, charging into ranks of soldiers and knights, loaded with men firing into the groups of knights and infantry. When Zizka died, his skin was made into a drum used to summon Hussites to battle. The Hussite revolution, however, was eventually put down.</string>
    <string _locid="100076">Cassadores are ranged infantry units unique to the Portuguese, occupying the same role as the Skirmisher. They have a vicious volley attack, but not many hitpoints.\n \nCassadores are available in the Fortress Age and are good against units they outrange. Their relatively low hitpoints mean they need to be kept out of range of enemy attacks more than most units, but when they can maintain their distance, they pack a mean punch.</string>
    <string _locid="100077">The Cassador (also Cazador) was a Portuguese light infantry during the Napoleonic era. The name comes from the Portuguese word for hunter. They formed batallions consisting of five companies, four companies of Cassadores and one company of elite tiradores.\n \nCassadores in the nineteenth century wore brown uniforms and were armed with muskets or rifles. They carried brown backpacks and gray blankets. They wore stovepipe shako hats with prominent green plumes on the front.</string>
    <string _locid="100078">Crossbowmen are a ranged infantry unit. Cheap to produce and available early, their range starts out very poor, but increases dramatically with their first upgrade. They cannot be upgraded beyond Veteran level.\n \nCrossbowmen are best fielded against slow, non-ranged units, so that they have time to fire a deadly barrage of crossbow bolts before they are forced to flee or fight hand-to-hand.</string>
    <string _locid="100079">Handheld crossbows began to appear in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Crossbowmen were attractive to military leaders because they took much less time to train than archers using bows. Firearms eclipsed Crossbows by the end of the sixteenth century.\n \nEuropeans, chiefly the Spanish, included crossbows amongst the muskets and cannon they brought to the New World. Cortes arrived with more than two dozen crossbows and less than ten muskets. Columbus' crew had crossbows when they landed in the West Indies. When the original stockpile of munitions ran out it was difficult or impossible to make or trade for more. Explorers had to be very careful with their limited supply.</string>
    <string _locid="100080">Doppelsoldners are a unique German infantry unit with high hitpoints and a sweeping attack that does area damage. Available in the Commerce Age, they are devastating in melee combat and tough enough to take on cavalry. Their attacks against buildings are also effective.\n \nThey are expensive to produce and take more population slots than a Halberdier, but the damage they do is worth it!</string>
    <string _locid="100081">Doppelsoldners were a group of specialized Landsknechts, whose role was to charge lines of pike and halberds. They were actually mercenaries that fought under Maximilian II. They were armed with halberds, arquebuses, and long two-handed swords (zweihanders). They stood in the front ranks and earned double the normal pay (and their name) from the privilege of breaking up ranks of pike.\n \nDress in this era was flamboyant, and Doppelsoldners are depicted with striped leggings, puffy sleeves (for mobility), large or elaborately plumed hats, and richly slashed and decorated uniforms.</string>
    <string _locid="100082">The Halberdier is a powerful but slow infantry unit with good hitpoints and damage, but no range. They do all of their damage in melee combat.\n \nA Halberdier is similar to a Pikeman, but better all around, though unavailable until a later Age. Although Pikemen do more damage to cavalry, Halberdiers are more well-rounded and a more powerful unit overall.</string>
    <string _locid="100083">Riders with lances had better range than halberdiers, so halberdiers often fought alongside Pikemen. The axe blade of a halberd was more than capable of cleaving plate armor, flesh and bone alike, but because the halberdier had to swing the long weapon with both hands, he was virtually defenseless when attacking. This required tight coordination and unwavering resolve within a regiment of halberdiers.\n \nThe halberd is essentially a very long-handled axe. It was a six foot staff of stout oak or ash topped by a long, stabbing spear point and a heavy axe blade balanced by a spike. The spear point was used to thrust and stab, the axe blade to cut through a mounted warrior's heavy armor, and the spike opposite the axe blade to push, or pull, riders off balance.</string>
    <string _locid="100084">The Janissary is a unique Ottoman infantry unit with good hitpoints, range, and a good attack. They are similar to Musketeers, but more expensive and powerful. They fight with a scimitar hand-to-hand, instead of a bayonet, for slightly less damage to cavalry.\n \nJanissaries are expensive, but a very good value for the single population slot they cost.</string>
    <string _locid="100085">The ranks of the janissaries were filled by all manner of people pressed into the service of the Sultan - slaves, European prisoners of war, or captured Christians. They were not allowed to wear beards or marry, but were known to enjoy wine. There is some disagreement whether they were required to remain celibate. Without families of their own, when a janissary died his property passed to his regiment, or ocak - a Turkish word meaning hearth. Their ranks were peppered with culinary terms; the commander was called the "head cook" and the next in command, the "soup distributor". They carried as a symbol of honor a heavy iron pot, which if lost or destroyed greatly disgraced the orta. They were encouraged to be independent, and could be very unruly and even disrespectful to their superiors. Many rose to political prominence in addition to being a powerful military presence. The janissaries were slaughtered in Constantinople in 1826, during an event now called the Auspicious Incident. The janissaries had gathered in protest to Mahmud II's imposition of European drill and discipline on the janissary corps. The sultan ordered them killed with no quarter by his newly raised regiments of European-style soldiers. The janissary corps was broken.\n \nJanissaries were known for their colorful dress, white felt hats and remarkable mustaches. They initially were armed with bows, but soon adopted muskets and rifles.</string>
    <string _locid="100086">The Longbowman is a unique British infantry unit that has a long range, decent attack, and poor hitpoints. They are available in the Commerce Age and until the Fortress Age, when Skirmishers and artillery come into play. They are the longest ranged unit.\n \nLongbowmen do not cost any Coin, so it is easy to leverage an early economy to make Longbowmen quickly. However, since Manors and Settlers also cost Wood and Food respectively, the choices compete with one another for early resources. Longbowmen rely on their range to do damage, and should avoid getting into melee combat at all costs.</string>
    <string _locid="100087">Used from the Neolithic Age up to middle of the seventeenth century, the bow fell out of use as early firearms and crossbows eclipsed them. Even though a good longbowman could fire an arrow every five seconds and volleys of arrows darkened the sky, eventually the savings in speed and time to manufacture firearms and train soldiers in their use outweighed the superior range and rate of fire of longbows. Add to this that rulers wanted to be on the cutting edge of warfare technologies so their armies would seem relevant and fashionable, and the longbow's days were numbered.\n \nThe Welsh longbow, which the English longbow is based on, was a yew staff of about six feet with a string of plant fibers or silk. It could take between two and four years to make a proper longbow, and a lifetime of practice to train a longbowman.</string>
    <string _locid="100088">The Militiaman is a ranged infantry unit with a good attack against siege units like Grenadiers, but diminishing hitpoints. When your town is under attack and you don't have an army ready to defend it, call out the Militiamen. They will come from the Town Center and fight off attackers.\n \nAs soon as the Militiamen appear, their hitpoints start to decrease. This makes their hitpoint bar act like a timer, indicating how long the Militiamen are effective. When their hitpoints drop to one the Militiamen can still move and fight, but taking any more damage kills them. You should therefore use them largely for defense against a surprise attack.</string>
    <string _locid="100089">Militiamen were recruited from the local population and could be quickly called to arms to defend cities and support professional armies in a case of war. In times of peace they often acted as police force to uphold public order. The level of organization, training and equipment differed greatly and was highly dependent on funds. The Minutemen were American militiamen who vowed to be ready in a minute's notice to fight against British soldiers leading up to and during the American Revolutionary War. They had no formal training and used their own weapons as arms, relying on hunting skills for marksmanship and guerilla tactics learned from the Native Americans in the recent French and Indian War. Monuments stand at the North Bridge in Concord and Battle Green Square in Lexington to commemorate the first fighting of the American Revolution, fighting done by Minutemen.</string>
    <string _locid="100090">The Musketeer is an infantry unit with decent hitpoints and range, and a good attack. Unlike most ranged units, Musketeers have a good attack against cavalry in hand-to-hand fighting. Consider Musketeers more like Pikemen, but with range, rather than archers or other light infantry. Musketeers are available to most Civilizations and are one of the most common units in the game.\n \nMusketeers are a good all-around unit, but not outstanding in any particular way. Certain Civilizations, like the British, have unique improvements to Musketeers that make them even better than regular fully upgraded Musketeer infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="100091">Musketeers were infantry soldiers who stood in ranks two and three men deep, taking turns firing while other ranks reloaded. Musketeers were drilled and disciplined to stand as close as 80 yards away from an enemy firing at them. Musket balls ranged from about a half inch in diameter to three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Until long guns with rifled barrels that could be fired more than once every two minutes were developed, muskets were the ranged weapon of choice for infantry.\n \nMuskets had a relatively short range and were wildly inaccurate. Musketeers fought a lot like longbowmen, firing volley after volley in the direction of the enemy with no specific target. The barrage of lead was bound to hit something. A competent musketeer could fire three shots in a minute - four times slower than a longbow and twice as fast as an early rifle.</string>
    <string _locid="100092">The Pikeman is an infantry unit with decent hitpoints and damage, but no range. They do all of their damage in melee combat.\n \nPikemen are best fielded against cavalry or buildings. They are cheap to train and cost no Coin, and may be trained in the Commerce Age. For most civilizations Pikemen cannot be upgraded beyond Veteran level for any civilization, except the Spanish.</string>
    <string _locid="100093">Pikemen fought in very tight formations that maximized the danger to enemies as they approached. The front rank would set their pikes against a cavalry charge, placing the butt of the staff against the ground, braced by the instep of their back foot, with the tip raised up at an angle. The rank standing just behind the first would hold their pikes straight out at about shoulder height to add still more stabbing spearheads. As firearms developed, they were integrated into units of pikemen. By the mid-seventeenth century an infantry regiment might be composed of two-thirds musketeers and a third pikemen. Eventually firearms with mounted bayonets came to replace pikes, which were little seen or used after the nineteenth century.\n \nA typical pike was a 10- to almost 20-foot spear-like wooden staff with a steel or iron spear point. Some pikemen also carried swords and axes to attack any enemies who survived the deadly bristling of pike formation. They wore helmets, and sometimes breastplates, to defend themselves against attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="100094">The Rodelero is a unique Spanish infantry unit with no range, good hitpoints, a good attack and great resistance to damage. They do all of their damage in melee combat.\n \nA Rodelero's greatest asset is speed, which is unusually high for infantry. They are better than most infantry at rushing artillery, but still have to slowly close the distance. It is a good idea to include ranged units with an army of Rodeleros to soften an enemy up before the Rodeleros wade into the battle.</string>
    <string _locid="100095">Rodeleros were a Spanish infantry who used swords and round shields. This arms combination was often used against formations of pike and halberds. Agile swordsmen could better evade the deadly iron of densely packed pikes and could take formations apart from the inside. In 1506 Cortez arrived in the New World with over 1,300 soldiers, 1,000 of which were rodeleros. They were adaptable, versatile soldiers, capable in close quarters on the decks of ships as well as against the loose, guerilla tactics of non-European enemies.\n \nRodela is a Spanish word meaning shield; Rodeleros are "shield-bearers." Rodeleros were armed with one-handed swords and round shields approximately two feet in diameter. These rodela were most often made of steel, but were also made of iron-bound wood covered with hide.</string>
    <string _locid="100096">The Skirmisher is an infantry unit with excellent range and damage, but relatively few hitpoints and a poor melee attack. They cannot stand long against tougher infantry or the cavalry units that close with them.\n \nSkirmishers tend to do well against non-ranged infantry because they are able to cause a lot of damage while the enemy infantry close. They are even effective against Musketeers, if only because of the Skirmisher's greater range. Cavalry will mow down Skirmishers if they can get close.</string>
    <string _locid="100097">Skirmishers were lightly armed and armored riflemen who used their speed to move quickly about the battlefield and perform a number of military roles. They defended flanks, helped artillerymen with cannon, dragged wounded soldiers off of the battlefield, and performed hit-and-run attacks on advancing enemy armies. Napoleonic-era skirmishers were effective against rigid ranks of musketeers because the fire of musketeers was less effective on the loose, informal skirmisher lines.\n \nMany skirmishers in the nineteenth century were armed with rifles; the range and accuracy of these weapons made skirmishers dangerous enemies. Early rifles could only be fired once every minute or two, though later breechloading and repeating models could fire much more rapidly. One model fired so fast, a commander ordered his men to focus their fire on a single enemy skirmisher so that they could recover his rifle to examine it.</string>
    <string _locid="100098">The Strelet is a unique Russian infantry unit with decent range, damage, and hitpoints. Strelets are trained in groups of no less than five, and are cheaper and less powerful than any other infantry unit in the game.\n \nThey are similar to Skirmishers in that their good range makes them effective against hand infantry or ranged infantry who cannot shoot as far. Cavalry are doom to Strelets. Available from the Blockhouse in the Commerce Age, Strelets are a good option if you are strapped for resources or are fighting a lot of infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="100099">Strelets (technically "streltsy" in Russian, because "strelets" is singular) were a Russian light infantry formed in the mid-sixteenth century by Tsar Ivan IV, and were Russia's first permanent standing infantry. They received a salary, a plot of land, and allotments of food and drink. This pay was rather meager, and strelets often found it necessary to supplement their income. An elite group of mounted strelets were the tsar's bodyguard and passed service to the tsar to their sons. The only way a man could become a member of this elite body was by birth.\n \nThe word strelet is derived from the Russian word for arrow, strela, and while it once referred to archers, over time it came to refer to the Russian ranged infantry in general. Strelets carried heavy, unwieldy firearms, sabers, and two-handed axes. These axes had a sharp point that could be shoved into the ground to provide a rest for cumbersome strelet muskets.</string>
    <string _locid="100100">Mercenaries are usually very strong versions of their base unit type, whether melee or ranged, infantry or cavalry. They can be sent from the Home City, Holy Sites, or Tribal Council after they are unlocked. They are the only Home City Shipments that cost Coin. \n \nAsian civilizations can train repentant mercenaries from the Monastery, while European civilizations can train mercenaries from the Saloon. Different units are available on different maps. Look for Ninjas on the Great Plains or Mamelukes in Araucania. Mercenaries are a good choice to send or train if you have the Coin to spare, especially if your enemy is using them.</string>
    <string _locid="100120">The Barbary Corsairs were pirates and privateers that raided trade routes and plundered cities on the Mediterranean Sea for hundreds of years. If they had a capitol, it was Algiers - a city captured by the Barbary pirates under their leader Kair Ad Din, more commonly known as Barbarossa. The corsairs had defended Algiers from the Spanish, but turned on the ruler and claimed the city for themselves.\n \nThe Corsairs sailed sleek Galleys, crewed by slaves who rowed and were meant only for short voyages of no more than six or eight weeks. Janissaries accompanied the crews and boarded enemy ships. The reign of the Barbary Corsairs ended in the first half of the nineteenth century when the growing pressure and assault on the pirate states from Europe and Ottoman forces shut down or took control of the Barbary Coast.</string>
    <string _locid="100121">Black Riders were also known as "devil riders" because of the blackened armor they wore. They first appeared in Germany in the sixteenth century. The Riders developed a special tactic known as "caracole," which allowed them to effectively bombard infantry units with constant weapons fire. In caracole, cavalry units created a tight formation. The units in front fired their weapons, and then quickly charged to the back to reload. The units that were just behind them fired immediately after the first row charged backwards to reload.</string>
    <string _locid="100122">The Hackapells, or Hakkapeliitta, were an elite cavalry of Finnish King Gustav II Adolph during the Thirty Years War. They get their name from their battle cry of, "Hakka paalle!" It roughly translates to "Cut them down!" but in spirit means, "Charge on!" Crying this, they were apparently so fearsome that their enemies thought they were protected by witchcraft.\n \nHackapells were very lightly armored, using their speed in the charge to get them into the thick of a fight quickly where they fought with swords and, later, small firearms.</string>
    <string _locid="100123">The Highlanders were clansmen warriors and soldiers from the highlands of Scotland. A group of Highlanders raised in 1745 under the banner of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, also known as Bonnie Prince Charles or the Young Pretender, fought against English royalist armies with the goal of restoring the Scottish line of kings (the Stuarts) to the throne of England. They were ultimately unsuccessful and many highlanders scattered to mainland Europe and America to escape the ruthless oppression of the Scottish Highlands. In their new homes, regiments of these Scotsmen fought as part of other armies.\n \nHighlanders carried swords, daggers and rifles. They wore kilts, bonnets (a seamless and brimless woolen cap typically with a strip of tartan around the headband) and double-breasted coats.</string>
    <string _locid="100124">Many nations in the late eighteenth century had one version or another of lightly armed huntsmen turned soldiers. They were highly mobile and good marksmen. Companies of these jaegers (German for hunters) were sold into mercenary service by their rulers to accompany British troops during the American Revolution, and they participated in every major engagement. Some were actual hunters, while others were debtors or criminals. The bulk of these jaegers were from Hesse-Cassel in Germany, and the whole group of them came to be known as Hessians. George Washington crossed the Delaware River on Christmas Eve in 1776 to make a surprise attack on the British at Trenton. His attack captured hundreds of Hessian soldiers and was a turning point for the flagging morale of Washington's troops and the American Revolution in general.\n \nJaegers carried rifles and a hunting sword called a hirschfaenger used for dressing elk. They wore green coats, wool pants, and three-cornered hats (or sometimes tall, pointed Grenadier miters). When mounted, Hessian jaegers carried carbines and sabres.</string>
    <string _locid="100125">Regiments of Landsknechts (German for "land knights," or "servants of the land") were formed by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. They began as top-notch pikemen, but integrated other weapons, including the new technologies and weapons beginning to appear in the late Renniassance. Doppelsoldners swung great two-handed swords and other Landsknechts were early adopters of the new-fangled arquebus, an early musket.\n \nLandsknechts were known for their outlandish and elaborate clothing. They wore striped leggings, broad-brimmed hats with large plumes, puffy sleeves, and elaborately slashed doublets.</string>
    <string _locid="100126">Mamelukes got their name from an Arabic word meaning "slave" or "owned." They were formed as a core soldiery of slave warriors, like the janissaries, valued because they had no allegiances except to their sultan. Eventually they grew so powerful that they installed themselves as the rulers of Egypt. Comprised originally of Turks and Mongols, and later to include Circassians and Georgians, the mamelukes were powerful soldiers and rulers in the Middle East for hundreds of years. Napoleon fought and defeated the mamelukes in the late eighteenth century when he attacked Cairo, later raising his own mameluke regiments. Rustam, a Georgian mameluke and one of Napoleon's personal bodyguards, came from these regiments.\n \nMamelukes fought mounted with sword and shield. They adopted firearms much later - too late, perhaps, to maintain their military power.</string>
    <string _locid="100127">The Manchu people overthrew the Ming dynasty in the middle of the seventeenth century. They established the Ch'ing dynasty and tried to remain separate from the general populace of China. They had been a nomadic people once, riding and fighting from horseback, and tending crops and herds. The Ch'ing dynasty ruled China for about 300 years.\n \nManchurian soldiers and warriors fought with recurve bows, swords, lances, halberds, and even their bare hands. They wore heavy robes that hung to the knee, allowing free movement on foot and horseback.</string>
    <string _locid="100128">Ronin were samurai who had no lord and, by extension, an uncertain role in feudal Japan. A famous group of ronin were samurai loyal to the daimyo Asano, who was disgraced and forced by the strictures of honor to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku. His death made ronin out of 47 of his samurai, who set out to avenge their master's dishonor. They killed the koke Kira who had lured their master into disgrace and, while admired by the people and considered heroes, these Ronin were eventually sentenced to death. They were given permission to follow their daimyo into the afterlife by commiting seppuku, rather than being executed as criminals.\n \nRonin, as samurai, fought with a wide array of weapons: katana, nodachi, kama, jutte, and their bare hands - though the katana is iconically associated with samurai. They wore elaborate armor, enameled and richly decorated.</string>
    <string _locid="100129">Nations sometimes recruited privateers to supplement their navy. Privateers were privately owned ships that had government sanction - issued as a letter of marque - to attack enemy's ships, both military and civilian. Without the permission granted by the letter of marque, these attacks were considered acts of piracy. It was difficult to control privateers once they were at sea, and often they would act outside the scope of their agreements. These abuses led to the abandonment of privateers in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n \nCaptain William Kidd was a famous privateer turned pirate. He was initially commissioned to hunt down Blackbeard, but he eventually went astray and became a pirate himself. Kidd was hanged in London in 1699.</string>
    <string _locid="100130">The Stradiotto were originally the cavalry of Giorgio Castriota, an Albanian who was raised a hostage of the Ottoman court, which named him Iskander Bey. He escaped his captivity and led a rebellion against the Ottomans that expelled them from Albania. His forces, the remnants of which were the Stradiots, used guerilla tactics and the rugged Albanian terrain to repel the Ottoman Turks. The Stradiots were later employed as mercenaries by the Venetians in the sixteenth century.\n \nThese cavalrymen were unruly and could be counted on to break off from a fight to raid camps or supply trains. They wore turkish clothes, including baggy pants and shirts and turkish mail, but eschewed turbans for European helmets. They typically carried short spears called assegai that had points on both ends, but also used swords, maces, and crossbows.</string>
    <string _locid="100131">Swiss soldiers hired themselves out as mercenaries in many European nations. They were known for their discipline and drill with pike and halberd, but by the end of the sixteenth century had adopted the arquebus, and even mounted soldiers armed with arquebuses. Swiss pikemen were ruthless on the battlefield. They were known to hang their own men for panicking, for giving no quarter to enemies who surrendered, and for loyalty as long as they were paid. The phrase, "No silver, no Swiss," referred to the price of their loyalty, and the consequences of not paying them. \n \nSwiss mercenaries wore a variety of uniforms, favoring colorful Landsknecht-style dress with striped leggings and mismatched stockings, and bright, slashed doublets and sleeves in alternating colors.</string>
    <string _locid="100132">The Eagle Warrior is an Aztec infantry unit with a good attack and decent range. The Eagle Warrior hurls javelins from an atlatl, but is weaker in melee combat. \n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Aztec Eagle Warrior does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Fast and ranged, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100133">Aztec warriors who had captured at least four enemy soldiers became eligible for the ranks of the Eagle warriors or the Jaguar warriors. Presumably this emphasis on capturing enemies was to collect a pool of captives for sacrifice, but the Aztecs were widely known for dealing death in battle, killing with single strokes of their obsidian swords, or hurling atlatl-driven flights of barbed spears. Warriors who caused confusion or disorder in the ranks were beaten on the spot and sometimes killed.\n \nEagle warriors were Aztec warriors whose dress incorporated feathers and a helmet that resembled an eagle's head. The eagle was a symbol of the sun, which was the focus of Aztec worship and sacrifice. Eagle warriors are usually depicted carrying shields and spears.</string>
    <string _locid="100134">The Jaguar Warrior is an Aztec infantry unit with a big attack, a lot of hitpoints, and no range. Because the Jaguar Warrior does his damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Aztec Jaguar Warrior does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Tough and strong, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>

Warriors who caused confusion or disorder in the ranks were beaten on the spot and sometimes killed.\n \nJaguar warriors were Aztec warriors whose dress incorporated bright colors and spots to evoke the imagery of a jaguar. The jaguar was a symbol of the night, a prowler and a predator, an appropriate model for an elite warrior. Jaguar warriors are often depicted carrying shields and obsidian swords.</string>
    <string _locid="100136">The Carib Blowgunner is a Carib infantry unit with good hitpoints and a decent ranged attack. The Carib Blowgunner does his damage at range, and it is good to maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Carib Blowgunner does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Fast and ranged, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100137">The Carib of the Lesser Antilles were warlike, skillfully navigating the waters of the Caribbean in canoes to raid other settlements - native and later, European - for women and food. Men and women spoke different languages, the men Carib and the women Arawak. It is thought that the Carib came from the northern coast of South America and drove off or killed the Arawak-speaking men, taking their women as wife-slaves.\n \nCarib warriors fought primarily with bows and blowguns. Their dress was minimal, primarily elaborate loincloths and necklaces for both men and women.</string>
    <string _locid="100138">The Cherokee Rifleman is an infantry unit with a good attack and good range. The Cherokee Rifleman does his damage at range and it is good to maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Cherokee Rifleman does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Fast and ranged, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100139">Stand Watie organized a group of Cherokee Riflemen that served with the Confederate States Army. Watie had been one of the three leaders who had signed the Treaty of New Echota without the knowledge or consent of other Cherokee leaders. The treaty resulted in the removal of the entire Cherokee nation to lands west of the Mississippi River in a massive militarily enforced migration that is known as "The Trail of Tears." Watie's regiment of riflemen were mounted and sometimes called the Cherokee Rangers. By the end of the Civil War, Stand Watie had earned the rank of Brigadier General in the Confederate Army and was the last of its generals to surrender to the Union Army.</string>
    <string _locid="100140">The Comanche Horse Archer is a cavalry unit with good speed, hitpoints, and a good ranged attack. They are particularly effective against hand cavalry. The Comanche Horse Archer does his damage at range; it is good to use this unit's speed to maintain range.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Comanche Horse Archer does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Fast and ranged, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100141">It is thought that the Comanche split off from the Shoshone and moved onto the Great Plains and south into Texas in pursuit of horses. After its introduction by the Spanish, the horse became an integral part of Comanche life. A man would spend much of his life astride a horse, and his family's wealth was measured in horses. The Comanche people successfully defended their lands from European settlers for almost a 100 years, fighting off wave after wave of settlers. They fought and hunted from horseback with short bows, lances, and buffalo hide shields.</string>
    <string _locid="100142">The Cree Tracker is an infantry unit with a good attack, good range, and decent hitpoints. The Cree Tracker does his damage at range; maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Cree Tracker does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Fast and ranged, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100143">The Cree were hunters, trappers, and nomads who traveled throughout the northern parts of North America. Plains Cree traveled south to follow the buffalo herds of the Great Plains. Forest Cree stayed in their lands hunting caribou, elk, and deer. They adopted horses, though not to the extent that the Comanche did, and used canoes, snowshoes, and dogs to travel the sometimes harsh environment of their homelands. The Cree were formed into loose warrior societies, much less formal than many other native groups. When the Cree fought, they used bows, clubs, axes, and rifles.</string>
    <string _locid="100144">The Incan Bolas Warrior is an infantry unit with a good attack and decent range. The Bolas Warrior does his damage at range; it is good to maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Incan Bolas Warrior does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Ranged and relatively tough, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit</string>
    <string _locid="100145">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the emperor could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and at the range of their various projectile weapons. Once they had loosed their missiles they closed in hand-to-hand fighting. The Inca used a wide variety of weapons: wooden sword-shaped clubs, star-headed maces, slings, spears, a sophisticated halberd, and bolas. They wore cotton armor that breathed well, allowed for free movement, and dissipated the force of blows. Bola are a relatively short-ranged weapon consisting of a pair of weights, stone or metal, joined by a chain or rope that entangles itself around the limbs of a target, injuring as it wraps tightly to hamper movement.</string>
    <string _locid="100146">The Incan Huaminca is an infantry unit with a big attack, a lot of hitpoints, and no range. He is particularly effective as a building killer. Because the Incan Huaminca does his damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Incan Huaminca does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population.

The Inca used a wide variety of weapons: wooden sword-shaped clubs, star-headed maces, slings, spears, a sophisticated halberd, and bolas. They wore cotton armor that breathed well, allowed for free movement, and dissipated the force of blows. Incan spears were sharpened lengths of wood, hardened in fire. Their halberd had a bronze-bladed axe head opposite a hook and crowned by a stabbing point allowing the huaminca a variety of arms and tactics.</string>
    <string _locid="100148">The Haudenosaunee Mantlet is an infantry unit with a big attack, a lot of hitpoints, decent range, and very good resistance to damage. Because the Mantlet can withstand enemy fire, they are good at attacking towers and other buildings. They do their damage at range and, as always, it is good to maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Haudenosaunee Mantlet does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Tough and strong, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100149">Because the Haudenosaunee often fortified their towns, they needed siege weapons when they went to war with rival towns. One technique they developed was the mantlet, similar in function to those used in Roman and medieval armies. Two warriors would carry the mantlet (essentially a moveable wooden wall) to protect themselves from enemy arrow or musket fire until they reached their enemy's town walls, where the mantlet was used as a ladder to scale the walls and breach the town. Canoes could also be used as shields and ladders, although canoes used for assaulting a fortress were not always the best paddling vessels after the fighting was over.</string>
    <string _locid="100150">The Tomahawk is an Haudenosaunee infantry unit with a good attack and short range. The Tomahawk does his damage at range, and it is good to maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Haudenosaunee Tomahawk does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Fast and ranged, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100151">The Tomahawk is a type of axe used by Native Americans. It has a wooden shaft and a stone, iron, or brass head. A popular version of the Tomahawk could double as a smoking pipe, blending together symbols of war and peace. Haudenosaunee men traded furs for these ingenious pipe tomahawks. Very ornate versions of these tomahawks were given as gifts to Native American leaders and were fashionable to both carry and wield.</string>
    <string _locid="100152">The Holcan Javelineer is a Maya infantry unit with a good attack and no range. Because the Holcan Javelineer does his damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Holcan Javelineer does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. They are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100153">The word "Holcan" means "warrior." Maya warriors formed a separate class in their society. In battle they would often capture rather than kill enemy soldiers to provide slaves or human sacrifices. The Holcan used many different weapons including spears, slingshots, clubs, knives, and even bombs made of hornet's nests. In times of need Maya used a form of conscription to force farmers or others to become soldiers.</string>
    <string _locid="100154">The Nootka Clubman is an infantry unit with a big attack, a lot of hitpoints, and no range. Because the Nootka Clubman does his damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Nootka Clubman does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Tough and strong, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100155">The Nootka lived in northwestern North America. Their common name is probable misinterpretation on the part of Captain Cook, who promoted the word meaning "come around" as the name for the Nootka people. The Nootka wore clothing of cedar bark that shed the rains of their Pacific Northwest home and also furs for the winter cold. They hunted whales and other sea creatures with two-headed harpoons that were designed to drive home even if one head was deflected or broken. In war they wielded heavy clubs and maces, some decorated with the striking surface protruding like a thick stone tongue from the mouth of a frightfully stylized man.</string>
    <string _locid="100156">The Seminole Sharktooth Bowman is an infantry unit with good range and attack, but few hitpoints. The Sharktooth Bowman does his damage at range; it is good to maintain this range whenever possible. Compared to other archers, the Sharktooth Bowman has a shorter range, but a higher attack - thanks to the shark teeth used as arrowheads.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Seminole Sharktooth Bowman does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Fast and ranged, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100157">The Seminole People are an offshoot of the Creeks. They left the traditional Creek lands and emigrated to Florida in the eighteenth century. For the most part, their cultural traditions maintained those of the Creeks. The Seminole fought two wars with the United States. The Second Creek war lasted for seven years and is the longest and costliest Native American War in US history. \n \nThe Seminole favor geometric patterns in their dress, and quickly embraced European cloth, especially wool, which they made into leggings. Red and blue were popular colors in their dress. Modern Seminoles have developed a patchwork style of clothing with colorfully repeated patterns, some of which represent Seminole beliefs and legends.</string>
    <string _locid="100158">The Lakota Axe Rider is a cavalry unit with a big attack, good speed, and no range. Because the Axe Rider does his damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close; though as a cavalry unit, he doesn't spend as much time closing.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Lakota Axe Rider does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Tough and strong, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100159">The Lakota form one part of a related group of people who speak the Lakota language. They lived on the Great Plains of the western United States and survived by hunting. Their favorite game was the American Bison, or Buffalo, which provided food, clothing, and shelter to the Lakota people.\n \nThe Lakota wore elaborately beaded and fringed leathers made from the hides of the animals they hunted. Weapons, and many other items, were made from the buffalo they hunted, with buffalo bones becoming both armor and weapons.</string>
    <string _locid="100160">The Blackwood Archer is a Tupi infantry unit with good range and attack, but few hitpoints. The Blackwood Archer does his damage at range; it is good to maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Tupi Blackwood Archer does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. They are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100161">Tupi warriors wore little or no clothing when they went into battle, though often they would paint themselves red or black. They would not fight after dark, but dawn would bring the sound of their horns calling the warriors to fight. The Tupi primarily used bows, which they fired rapidly and with an accuracy that amazed the Europeans - mostly Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch - who encountered them. Fighting between family groups was commonplace among the Tupi, and they did not hesitate to add the European invaders to the list of their enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="100162">This Canoe is available only if you have made an alliance with a nearby Native American tribe. If you have, you can train Canoes from your Dock. They have a decent attack with a relatively short range, but are cheaper than larger ships.\n \nThey can be used as transports and - though it seems unlikely - they are able to transport cavalry and even artillery. So don't worry that you won't be able to load all of your units into the Canoe.</string>
    <string _locid="100163">The word canoe comes from Arawak, a language spoken by the natives of the Caribbean. It refers to boats generically, but has come to mean a specific kind of vessel. The birch-bark canoe, common to the Native Americans in northeastern North America, is what most people would identify as a canoe. Small birch-bark canoes could accommodate as few as one or two people; the largest canoes could hold more than three dozen. Canoes allowed Native Americans, and later Europeans, to navigate the many rivers and creeks of North America. The craft were light enough to be carried and durable enough to last years if properly maintained.\n \nCanoe builders peeled the outer bark off of a birch tree, making a long cut down the length of the trunk to reveal the inner bark, then peeled that from the tree in layers. The inner bark of a tree left standing would grow a new coating of outer bark, allowing the tree survive the canoe-making process. White cedar, because of its resistance to decay, was used for the canoe frame. Cuts, called gores, allowed the birch bark sheathing to be sewn together and fitted to the frame. Ribs shaped from boiled cedar gave the canoe strength and tension. Pitch made from pine tar or gum sealed the seams, and the birch-bark canoe was ready to paddle.</string>
    <string _locid="100164">On water maps players usually start with a Caravel, a small ship that can fish, scout shorelines, and transport Settlers and soldiers. It sinks quickly when attacked by any ships of the line (Galleons, Frigates, Monitors) or defensive buildings (Town Centers and upgraded Outposts). Artillery and even a group of units can sink a Caravel in reach of their weapons.\n \nThe best thing about the Caravel is that often the first one is free! Players sometimes forget that they have a starting Caravel and focus their activities on land, but using a starting ship well can be key to a successful game. Controlling the waterways of a map means a player has free rein to scout, fish, and transport troops. Learning the balance between managing land and water activities is the trick.</string>
    <string _locid="100165">Caravels were developed by Portuguese shipwrights in the fourteenth century, and were initially used to explore the coast of Africa. They had two masts with square sails and one forward triangular, or lateen, sail. They were relatively small ships and wide for their length, giving them a shallow draft and the ability to sail safely in shallow waters. These two factors made them extremely popular with explorers until the Spanish Galleon took over about 200 years later.\n \nApproximate weight: 80 tons. Length: 50 feet.</string>
    <string _locid="100166">The Fluyt is a unique Dutch ship with a lot of hitpoints and a good attack. It is better against other ships than the Galleon, but not as powerful as a Frigate. The Fluyt is available in limited numbers after reaching the Commerce Age.\n \nThe Fluyt's special ability is that it operates like a floating Barracks and can train infantry, or cavalry. The ship cannot move while training. Though they were mostly trade vessels historically, the Fluyt makes an excellent troop transport. This allows you to train the units when you need them, rather than having to load the Fluyt with units trained from buildings. Trained units, though, can board a Fluyt and be transported across bodies of water, just as in the Caravel, Frigate, Galleon, Galley, and Monitor.</string>
    <string _locid="100167">The Fluyt is a ship of Dutch design dating from the seventeenth century. They have a shallow draft and a large cargo hold, and can be handled by a very small crew. The Dutch imported relatively cheap wood and tried to mass produce as many parts of the ship as possible. Other nations commissioned their own Fluyts, and the Dutch innovations in ship construction paid off not only in cargo but in the hulls they sold to other countries.\n \nApproximate weight: 300 tons. Length: 105 feet.</string>
    <string _locid="100168">The Frigate is a fast ship, with a lot of hitpoints and a high attack. It is very powerful against other ships, but vulnerable to buildings and land-based artillery. The Frigate is available in a limited number after reaching the Industrial Age.\n \nFrigates have a special Broadside attack that fires all of their cannon in a deadly barrage. This attack must recharge before being used again. Frigates can be constructed in the New World or sent from the Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="100169">Frigates changed a lot over time, but began as lean, fast, well-armed ships used for scouting, raiding trade routes, and filling in the line of battle when the larger battleships were scarce. Early frigates carried messages and important passengers. Later, their single deck of 20 to 30 cannon was doubled to two decks of 40 to 60 cannon. British frigate captains still using the swift, lighter frigates were ordered not to engage the heavier, deadly American frigates unless the odds were two-to-one in the British captain's favor.\n \nApproximate weight: 950 tons. Length: 150 feet.</string>
    <string _locid="100170">The Galleon is a strong ship, with a lot of hitpoints and a good attack. It is good against other ships, and is resistant to buildings and land-based artillery. The Galleon is available in a limited number after reaching the Commerce Age.\n \nThe Galleon's special ability is that it operates like a floating Barracks, able to train infantry, or cavalry. The ship cannot move while training. This makes the Galleon an excellent troop transport because it allows you to train the units when you need them, rather than having to load it with units trained from buildings, though units can board a Galleon and be transported across water bodies just as in the Caravel, Frigate, Galley, and Monitor.</string>
    <string _locid="100171">These square-rigged, three-masted warships were used primarily by European powers in the fifteenth through eighteenth centuries. Well-suited for carrying cargo and for war, galleons made up the bulk of the famous Spanish Treasure Fleet that carried plunder from the Americas back to Spain's waiting coffers. They carried around 30 cannon, fired from two decks in broadsides. Adaptations to the basic galleon design yielded heavy Spanish Galleons and the lighter, more maneuverable galleons of the British and other European nations. They were eventually replaced as multipurpose ships by the clipper, a fast cargo ship, and the massive Man-of-War.\n \nApproximate weight: 500 tons. Length: 120 feet.</string>
    <string _locid="100172">The Galley is a unique Ottoman warship that replaces the Caravel. It can fish for Food, scout shorelines, and transport Settlers and soldiers. It sinks quickly when attacked by any ships of the line (Galleons, Frigates, Monitors) or defensive buildings (Town Centers and upgraded Outposts). Artillery and even a group of units can sink a Caravel in reach of their weapons.\n \nThe best thing about the Galley is that often the first one is free! Players sometimes forget that they have a starting Galley and focus their activities on land, but using a starting ship well can be key to a successful game. Controlling the waterways of a map means a player has free rein to scout, fish, and transport troops. Learning the balance between managing land and water activities is the trick.</string>
    <string _locid="100173">Galleys were ships powered by both oar and sail. They were mostly used in the Mediterranean, and developed into other varieties that emphasized sail over oars, like the galliot and galleass. The men at the oars were often slaves or convicts, chained to their posts while a ship sat at anchor. Most galleys had cannon that fired only forward, though some designs allowed for both rowers and cannons, giving the galley a broadside attack.\n \nApproximate weight: 250 tons. Length: 140 feet.</string>
    <string _locid="100174">The Monitor is a strong ship, with a lot of hitpoints a good range, and a big attack. This range makes the Monitor the only ship that is good against buildings, but it is vulnerable to other ships or land-based artillery. The Monitor is available in a limited number after reaching the Industrial Age.</string>
    <string _locid="100175">Bomb ships or bomb ketches were made by removing the front masts of a warship to make room for one or more deck-mounted mortars. These ships could then bombard an enemy fortress from several miles away. The Star-Spangled Banner, the US national anthem, refers to such a bombardment.</string>
    <string _locid="100176">This vagabond is guarding a New World Treasure. In order to collect the Treasure, which may be resources, experience, or even Settlers or soldiers, you must kill these guardians. Any unit can attack a Treasure guardian, but only an Explorer or a gatherer can collect the Treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="100178">The Carib Ambusher is an infantry unit with good hitpoints and a decent ranged attack. The Carib Ambusher does his damage at range; it is good to maintain this range whenever possible.\n \nThis Carib Ambusher was recovered by an Explorer or Settler and cannot be replaced. He is well-suited to accompany the Explorer in collecting Treasures and scouting either on his own or with the Explorer.</string>
    <string _locid="100179">The Carib of the Lesser Antilles were warlike, skillfully navigating the waters of the Caribbean in canoes to raid other settlements, native and later European, for women and food. They poisoned their blowgun darts with the sap of the machineel tree, which caused burning blisters and severe pain.</string>
    <string _locid="100180">The Explorer is a tough infantry unit with a good ranged attack and a lot of hitpoints. They have a special sharpshooter attack that they can use every couple of minutes to kill a Treasure guardian with one shot. In the Industrial Age, the Explorer also gains the ability to kill any unit with one shot. Explorers have a good line of sight and can collect Treasures and build Trading Posts.\n \nIf an Explorer falls in a fight, he collapses and has to generate enough hitpoints to be recovered by allies. A fallen Explorer can also be ransomed back. In the Town Center you can choose to pay a ransom to the player who disabled your Explorer.</string>
    <string _locid="100181">Explorers set out for the New World with a variety of backgrounds and missions. Some were nobles seeking fame and wealth; others were slaves forced to accompany their masters. Some wanted to claim new lands for the nations that sponsored their voyages; others wanted to explore the lands, their peoples, and the flora and fauna.\n \nEstevanico was a slave from Morocco, sold to the Spaniard Andres de Dorantes. Dorantes joined an expedition to explore the Gulf Coast from Florida to Mexico. The ill-fated venture ended with only eighty of the original crew floating on makeshift rafts, only two of which landed on the shores of Texas near Galveston with neither food, nor water. Dorantes and Estevanico set out on their own, traveling west and south. They were captives for five years, faith healers, and legends amongst the Native Americans of the area. They eventually reached Mexico City where the viceroy refused to allow Dorantes to search Texas for the Seven Cities of Gold. Dorantes sold Estevanico to the viceroy and left for Spain.\n \nEstevanico accompanied a missionary, Father Marcos de Niza, north ranging ahead and speaking to the Native Americans he encountered about the white men following in his wake. Estevanico had runners carry crosses back to Father Niza, their size indicating the promise of the region. Each new cross that Father Niza received was larger than the previous cross, and then he received one that was massive. Estevanico had discovered a Zuni pueblo; it is unknown whether he thought this pueblo was one of the Cities of Gold, but he spent an evening camped outside the town. In the morning, the Zuni attacked and killed him, fearing his presence was a bad omen.</string>
    <string _locid="100182">The Explorer's trusty canine companion can be unlocked in the Home City. This dog can help explore, find Treasures, and fight enemies. If hurt badly, the Explorer Dog is disabled and must be rescued. Their names are generated randomly from a giant list of Ensemble Studio employee's pets' names, so please take good care of them!</string>
    <string _locid="100183">The Spanish Conquistadors brought dogs with them to the New World. These were big, fierce dogs, probably a mix of mastiff and greyhound. They were good at tracking, hunting, and killing prey (often human). Becerrillo, which means "little bull calf," was owned by Spanish Conquistador Ponce de Leon. Becerrillo sired the more famous Leoncico, "little lion," who stowed away in a wooden cask with his owner, the explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa.</string>
    <string _locid="100184">The Lakota Tokala Soldier is a cavalry unit with a big attack, good hitpoints, good speed, and no range. Because the Dog Soldier does his damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close, though as a cavalry unit he doesn't spend as much time closing.\n \nLike all Native American warriors, the Lakota Dog Soldier does not take any population space, making them an excellent unit to train if you have reached the upper limits of your population. Tough and strong, they are an excellent unit to train, even if you haven't reached your population limit.</string>
    <string _locid="100185">Tokala Soldiers were an elite warrior society of the Cheyenne tribe that sometimes allied with the Lakota. They wore long sashes that dragged the ground, and carried sacred arrows that they would stab through the sash into the ground to show that they were ready to fight and die where they stood. They had a special song that they would sing when faced with death that only Tokala Soldiers were allowed to sing. They were the fiercest warriors of the Cheyenne.</string>
    <string _locid="100186">The Nootka War Chief is an infantry unit with a big attack, a lot of hitpoints, and no range. Because the Nootka War Chief does his damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close.\n \nThis Nootka War Chief was called by an Explorer. He is well-suited to accompany the Explorer in collecting Treasures and scouting either on his own or with the Explorer. Only a limited number of Nootka War Chiefs can be called by an Explorer.</string>
    <string _locid="100188">Blowguns, or blowpipes, are common hunting tools for native tribes inhabiting the rain forests of the Amazon and southern Central America. They are extremely accurate, though not particularly strong as weapons. Without poisons they are capable of taking down only very small prey, such as birds and tiny mammals. Curare is a famous dart poison that can be extracted from the roots, sprouts, and bark of a number of plants.\nCurare relaxes muscles and kills when it relaxes the muscles that control breathing. Tiny animals can die in a matter of seconds, larger animals a couple of minutes, and humans in an hour or so. The relaxation is temporary, and a victim who receives artificial respiration for the duration of the poison's effects may survive. The brightly colored poison dart frog is the source of one of the most deadly toxins known. Hunters roast these frogs to harvest their poisons. Not all poison dart frogs are poisonous and the toxins they secrete may actually be related to a diet of insects that eat toxic plants and pass the toxins on to the frogs. Poison dart frogs in captivity, fed a steady diet of 'clean' insects, have eventually lost their toxins and become safe to handle.</string>
    <string _locid="100189">The term "bandit" derives from Italian and describes a criminal who acts on his own or is part of a band of robbers - one who lived outside the protections of the law and should be killed on sight. The gun-slinging, horse-riding, bandana-wearing outlaw of the American frontier is a common image, and one lived up to by famous shootist Billy the Kid, a career thief and cattle rustler. He escaped capture on a number of occasions and is thought to have been shot dead at the age of 21. Some think he died in the early 20th century in the far west Texas town of Hico.</string>
    <string _locid="100190">The term "bandit" derives from Italian and describes a criminal who acts on his own or is part of a band of robbers - one who lived outside the protections of the law and should be killed on sight. The gun-slinging, horse-riding, bandana-wearing outlaw of the American frontier is a common image. One such outlaw, Jesse James, used his knowledge of guerilla tactics in warfare to execute a series of bank robberies. He and his brothers lived a life of crime for decades, before James was killed by one of his own gang members when his bounty grew too high to resist.</string>
    <string _locid="100191">The term "bandit" derives from Italian and describes a criminal who acts on his own or is part of a band of robbers - one who lived outside the protections of the law and should be killed on sight. The gun-slinging, horse-riding, bandana-wearing outlaw of the American frontier is a common image, and one embodied by Thomas Coleman Younger and his two brothers. They joined up with Jesse James and were eventually captured and paroled, though not before one of Cole's brothers died of tuberculosis while imprisoned and the other killed himself out of grief. Cole was pardoned and lived the rest of his life honestly, making a lecture circuit and performing in a traveling Wild West show.</string>
    <string _locid="100192">Pirates, or buccaneers, are sailors who prowl sea lanes, killing sailors, capturing ships, and looting cargo. The centuries following the Spanish plunder of the Aztec, Inca, and Maya was the golden age of piracy. Spanish galleons, wallowing low in the water from all the treasure taken onboard, were returning from the Caribbean to Spain, where the gold would fund wars against the French, the Ottomans, and the Dutch. The treasure galleons were slow, fat targets, very well-defended and wholly irresistible to pirates. In 1628, five years after he had arrived in the West Indies, Piet Hien, a Dutch trader for the West India Company, could not resist taking on the treasure fleet. He managed to corner part of the fleet in the Bay of Matanzas and captured millions upon millions of guilders in gold, silver, and trade goods.\n \nSome pirate bands were highly democratic, electing their captains and making important decisions by vote. Food, drink, and wealth were split between all crew members, with larger shares going to officers. Pirates disabled while crewing a ship were given a large lump sum as compensation. There were very harsh punishments for stealing from or striking crew members, and gambling was generally restricted.</string>
    <string _locid="100193">War Dogs are primarily trained by the Spanish Explorer. They cost little food and are a big aid in exploring, hunting Treasures in the New World, and harassing Settlers.\n \nChoosing certain Politicians as you advance in Age will make your Explorer and his War Dogs even tougher.</string>
    <string _locid="100194">The Spanish Conquistadors brought dogs with them to the New World. These were big, fierce dogs, probably a mastiff and greyhound mix. They were good at tracking, hunting, and killing (often human) prey. Becerrillo, which means "little bull calf," was owned by Spanish Conquistador Ponce de Leon. Becerrillo sired the more famous Leoncico, "little lion," who stowed away in a wooden cask with his owner, the explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa.</string>
    <string _locid="100195">The Coureur des Bois is the main resource gatherer for the French. Coureurs des Bois are expensive compared to standard Settlers, but have a good attack and decent range. They are, however, not meant for combat, but will defend themselves better than the gatherers of other nations. Coureurs des Bois can be used to collect Treasures.\n \nThere is a limit to the number of Coureurs des Bois that the French can have at once. They pay for themselves rather quickly, and the longer an individual Coureur des Bois is alive, the more he contributes to the overall wealth of a given colony. Coureurs des Bois can be sent from the Home City, trained in the New World and, if you have an alliance, trained at Cree settlements.</string>
    <string _locid="100196">Coureur des Bois is French for "runner in the woods," the name given to a group of French fur traders. They came from all walks of French and colonial French life to hunt and trap animals for their pelts in North America. One of the first native-born Canadian explorers was Louis Jolliet, who at a young age determined that he would become a Coureur des Bois. He and a handful of other Coureurs des Bois paddled down the Mississippi river in canoes, determining that it would empty into the Gulf of Mexico, but feared to travel as far as the mouth into the hands of the Spanish. They noted rivers to the west as they went, hoping that one would flow into the seas of China or Japan. He became well-established in the fur trade and had several land holdings that he traveled between. It was on a trip to one of these that he died in 1700.</string>
    <string _locid="100197">The Fishing Boat is a gatherer that can be used for gathering Food from fish or Coin from whales. If you plan to build a fleet of Fishing Boats, you should put many of your Settlers to work gathering Wood.\n \nFishing can be a very good source of Food, but these fragile ships have to be protected from attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="100198">Fishing was a huge industry in northeastern North America, where poor soil did not readily support extensive agriculture. Fish and shellfish were abundant in the waters of the Atlantic and in time a thriving industry of fishing, whaling and shipbuilding developed. The Gloucester Schooner was a long, sleek, two-masted fishing vessel first constructed in 1713 in Gloucester, Massachusetts. These ships plied the waters of the Atlantic for cod, halibut, and mackerel, sometimes salting their catches at sea or, when close to the coast, bringing them in fresh.</string>
    <string _locid="100199">The Settler is the main resource gatherer for most Civilizations in the game. Settlers are relatively inexpensive but fragile; they are not meant for combat, but will fire weak muskets to defend themselves and others. Settlers can be used to collect Treasures.\n \nEach Civilization has a limit to the number of Settlers they can have at once. Settlers pay for themselves rather quickly, and the longer an individual Settler is alive, the more he contributes to the overall wealth of a given colony. Some Civilizations may receive Shipments of extra Settlers from the Home City, while others have to rely solely on producing them in the New World.</string>
    <string _locid="100220">Highly industrious and loyal to a fault, the Settler lives to work for you. Whether it's chopping down the seventeen thousandth tree, scurrying across the map to a distant pile of silver ore, or endlessly toiling away at a mill, the Settler is ready to happily tackle any tedious task. The Settler‚Äôs hobbies include running away from enemy soldiers, getting thrown into the river by enemy cannon fire, and crochet.</string>
    <string _locid="100221">The Settler Wagon is a unique German resource gatherer. Settler Wagons are relatively expensive and tough compared to a Settler, but they are not meant for combat. Settler Wagons fire weak muskets solely to defend themselves and others. Settler Wagons can be used to collect Treasures.\n \nThere is a limit to the number of Settler Wagons a German player can have at once. Settler Wagons pay for themselves rather quickly, and the longer an individual Wagon is alive, the more it contributes to the overall wealth of a given Colony. Settler Wagons can only be shipped from Europe.</string>
    <string _locid="100222">Prairie Schooners and Conestoga Wagons were two types of covered wagons used by settlers and pioneers to cross the early frontiers of North America. Prairie Schooners were lighter and needed two or four horses or oxen to pull them. Conestoga Wagons were big, heavy wagons that needed teams of six or eight to pull them along. Before railroad tracks crisscrossed the Great Plains, Conestoga Wagons hauled most of the freight that went back and forth between the east and west coasts. Conestoga Wagons originated in a German area of Pennsylvania.</string>
    <string _locid="100223">The Imam is a unit that heals other units. He has a poor attack, but may heal other units at a short range. Unlike Priests the Imam costs food instead of coin.\n \nOnly the Ottomans can send Imams from their Home City or train them from the Mosque after reaching the Commerce Age. Units do not regenerate their health on their own, so Imams can prolong the life of your armies significantly.</string>
    <string _locid="100224">Imam can refer to a religious leader who guides salat prayer services in a mosque, but also to a leader or ruler with political authority. Imam Shamil was a nineteenth century religious and military leader who fought against Russian armies of his homeland in present day Daghestan, which lies between Chechnya and the Caspian Sea. The inhabitants of the northern Caucasus had fought incursion by other rulers for centuries, against the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and against Russia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. After the deaths of the first and second Imams of Daghestan (Ghazi Mollah and Gamzat-bek), Imam Shamil took over the guerilla resistance to the Tsar's armies. Shamil became the third Imam of Daghestan and is known for his great physical strength and for his iron-fisted resistance to Russia.</string>
    <string _locid="100225">The Healer is a unit that heals other units. He has a poor attack, but may heal other units at a short range.\n \nUnits do not regenerate their health on their own, so a Healer can prolong the life of your armies significantly.</string>
    <string _locid="100226">Both "Healer" and "Elder" refer to Native American healers and spiritual leaders. Not all were male and many of their responsibilities had little to do with physical healing. They were responsible for both the physical and the spiritual health of the people in their nation.</string>
    <string _locid="100227">The Missionary is a unique Spanish cavalry unit that heals other units. He has a poor attack, but may heal other units at a short range. The Spanish Missionary is the only mounted healer in the game.\n \nOnly the Spanish can send Missionaries from the Home City or train them from the Church after reaching the Commerce Age. Units do not regenerate their health on their own, so Missionaries can prolong the life of your armies significantly.</string>
    <string _locid="100228">Spanish priests and monks established missions all over the New World. The selection of a site wasn't based simply on divine inspiriaton; it was a complicated process involving weeks, months, and even years of navigating bureaucracies and scouting out sites with sufficient water and good defensive qualities. It was very important that missions, forts, and towns had access to good water, because once established, they were largely on their own to look after their needs.\n \nMissionaries, like the Italian Jesuit Eusebio Kino, oversaw the establishment of several missions. Father Kino, who explored and traveled with the Spanish, established dozens of missions including the missions at Nuestra Senora de los Dolores, San Xavier del Bac, Guevavi, and Tumacacori. He was known for a policy of kindness towards Native Americans, and often established peaceful relationships with groups of Native Americans near his missions.</string>
    <string _locid="100229">The Priest is a unit that heals other units. He has a poor attack, but may heal other units at a short range.\n \nMost Civilizations send Priests from the Home City or train them from the Church after reaching the Commerce Age. Units do not regenerate their health on their own, so Priests can prolong the life of your armies significantly.</string>
    <string _locid="100230">Religion was at the core of early colonial life, whether seeking religious freedoms in the New World or making the arduous journey to convert the Native Americans. Priests, pastors, and lay leaders of the various settlements, colonies, and missions sought to give strength to the struggling communities, binding them together through the bond of shared faith.\n \nThough he was never ordained, William Ames‚Äô works made him a prominent theologian in the New World, though he never made it to the colonies. Persecution for non-conformist religious practices sent him to Holland, where he spent many years teaching and writing, dogged by the British sovereignty until he decided that it was time to venture to the New World. He grew sick and died before he could make the trip, but his works were treasured by Protestant colonists in the New World.</string>
    <string _locid="100231">The Surgeon is a unit that heals other units. He has a poor attack, but may heal other units at a short range.\n \nSurgeons are sent from the Home City and cannot be trained in the New World. Units do not regenerate their health on their own, so Surgeons can prolong the life of your armies significantly. Surgeons can also construct a Field Hospital. The Hospital is a special building that swiftly heals nearby units.</string>
    <string _locid="100232">Battlefield surgery in the Napoleonic era was some of the earliest modern surgery, focusing chiefly on amputating severely broken or damaged limbs. Some surgeons advocated immediate amputation to take advantage of the effects grievous wounds had on the body: numbness around the injury and low blood pressure brought on by shock. Removing a limb required shutting off as much blood flow to the limb as possible by the application of tourniquets. A knife cut away the flesh in what would later become a stump. Arteries were then clamped off and a bone saw would make quick work of a femur or tibia. Arteries were then stitched closed, the wound bandaged, covered and left to heal.\n \nDominique Larrey was a pioneer in battlefield surgery, the first to use ambulances to bring first-aid to soldiers in battle and the first to use triage in determining which wounded to evacuate. He participated in dozens of battles with the French armies and was eventually made a baron by Napoleon.</string>
    <string _locid="100233">Covered Wagons construct Town Centers. Each wagon is capable of building one Town Center. Sent from the Home City after reaching the Fortress Age, the Covered Wagon has a good line of sight and a lot of hitpoints, but is slow and cannot fight. Some maps may even start all players with a Covered Wagon, but no Town Center.\n \nCovered Wagons are useful when expanding a colony. Sending one or more allows Town Centers to be built across a given territory, spreading out control, or to strongly defend a single area.</string>
    <string _locid="100234">Covered wagons were so full of food and other supplies that settlers who traveled west could rarely expect to travel inside them. These wagons were so uncomfortable and bumpy that more than a few settlers were happy to walk. The ride could be so bumpy that a butter churn filled with milk at the beginning of the day would have produced butter by the end of the day. Covered wagons traveled about two miles per hour. Until steam-powered trains could reach the frontier, the West was won very slowly.</string>
    <string _locid="100235">The Envoy is a unique Dutch unit with lots of hitpoints and a very good line of sight. The Envoy has a poor attack and is designed for scouting and exploring.\n \nOnce you are done exploring, you can place the Envoy on the edges of your colony or out in the wilderness to give advance warning of your enemies' movements.</string>
    <string _locid="100236">Envoys are agents of a government dispatched on diplomatic missions. George Washington served as an envoy to the French with the mission of determining their military strength in the Ohio River Valley and letting the French know that the British wanted them to retreat from the area. He was leading a ragtag group of soldiers to support the construction of Fort Necessity in the valley when his command ran across a small French army. Washington's men killed 10 Frenchmen, including another French envoy carrying a message to the British. Killing an envoy was a breach of military etiquette. This brief exchange was the first in what became the French and Indian War.</string>
    <string _locid="100237">Hot Air Balloons are unlocked in the Home City and trained from Explorers and Heroes. They reveal a huge area, allowing a player to see the units of enemy players from far away.\n \nHot Air Balloons cannot be attacked, but they do not persist for very long and it is several minutes before a player can train another.</string>
    <string _locid="100238">Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier are to hot air balloons what Orville and Wilbur Wright are to airplanes. They believed that their balloons were held aloft by smoke, burning hay and even shoes to keep early balloons up. Within just a few years, balloons appeared on the battlefield to scout and observe enemy movements and deployments. </string>
    <string _locid="100240">The Learicorn is a unique cavalry unit with good speed and, quite surprisingly, a massive attack. I heartily suggest running your army in the opposite direction if you ever see the Learicorn. Even if it's your own, just run.\n \nThe Learicorn seems harmless enough but is, in fact, a harbinger of certain rainbow-shrouded doom. Resembling nothing so much as a friendly magician riding his trusty unicorn steed, the Learicorn's battle cry of "Sure, sure, keep kicking the pitbull," sends chills up the spine of all who hear it.\n \nThe only known predator of the Learicorn is the chopstick and pottery-fragment wielding leviathan, Ianicus Fischerii. And George Crushington.</string>
    <string _locid="100241">The Native Scout has a lot of hitpoints and a very good line of sight. The Native Scout has a poor attack and is designed for scouting and exploring.\n \nOnce you are done exploring, you can place the Native Scout on the edges of your colony or out in the wilderness to give advance warning of your enemies' movements.</string>
    <string _locid="100242">Europeans who colonized the Americas often sought help from Native American scouts. The scouts were mostly used to gather intelligence on enemy military movements. In 1866, Congress passed a statute that established a branch of the military known as the "Indian Scouting Service." This formalized the relationship between Native American Scouts and the United States Army. When fighting Native Americans in the west, the United States made use of historic tribal animosities by recruiting scouts from the enemy of whomever they were fighting. For example, Pawnees scouted against the Cheyenne, and Crow scouts helped General Custer before the Battle of Little Bighorn.</string>
    <string _locid="100243">The Stagecoach travels along a predetermined Trade Route and delivers Experience, Food, Wood, or Coin to any Trading Post it passes. At this level, the road is a packed, rutted track that can be improved one more time. The Trade Route appears as a white line on the Mini Map. Any player can build on an unclaimed Trading Post site. Enemy players can own Trading Posts along the same Trade Route.\n \nBuilding a Trading Post along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or increase the speed at which shipments come from the Home City. The locomotive is the last upgrade available for the Trade Route and moves faster along the route, delivering goods more quickly than the Stagecoach and Travois.\n \nAnyone who has built a Trading Post along a Trade Route is granted line of sight around the Stagecoach. This means that as the Stagecoach passes into the Fog of War, or completely unexplored areas, you can see what is immediately beyond it.</string>
    <string _locid="100244">Stagecoaches were used to transport passengers and mail along overland routes before the rise of railways. Stagecoaches were four-wheeled wagons that could accommodate a dozen passengers (or more if passengers rode outside with the driver). Teams of four, six, or eight horses pulled stagecoaches. As a result, horse breeds with great strength and speed emerged and were valued as teams for drawing stagecoaches. Passengers could expect a bumpy, uncomfortable trip in spite of the thick leather straps used as shock absorbers.</string>
    <string _locid="100245">The train travels along a predetermined Trade Route and delivers Experience, Food, Wood, or Coin to any Trading Post it passes. The Trade Route starts as a dirt track and can be improved over the course of a game. The Trade Route appears as a white line on the Mini Map. Any player can build on an unclaimed Trading Post site. Enemy players can own Trading Posts along the same Trade Route.\n \nBuilding a Trading Post along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or increase the speed at which shipments come from the Home City. The locomotive is the last upgrade available for the Trade Route. It delivers goods more quickly than the Stagecoach and Travois.</string>
    <string _locid="100246">The caboose is the last car in a train and contains the train crew's sleeping quarters and kitchen. Cabooses started as wooden shacks built on flatcars to shelter cookfires and sleeping crewmembers. Crew in the caboose kept an eye on the train, so that the crew in the Engine could keep an eye on the track ahead. If the train separated in the middle, the crew in the caboose could put emergency brakes on to stop the loose train.</string>
    <string _locid="100247">The first locomotive made in the United States used rifle barrels for the tubes of its boilers. Early steam engines went through several iterations and changes before they adopted their familiar shape.</string>
    <string _locid="100248">Early freight cars were largely made of wood with cast-iron wheels and hand brakes. They carried all manner of goods north and south, east and west across North America. Flatcars were used to carry large, bulky objects, and boxcars were used to transport smaller goods.</string>
    <string _locid="100251">The Travois travels along a predetermined Trade Route and delivers Experience, Food, Wood, or Coin to any Trading Post it passes. The Trade Route starts as a dirt track that can be improved over the course of a game to increase the speed at which goods are delivered. The Trade Route appears as a white line on the Mini Map. Any player can build on an unclaimed Trading Post site. Enemy players can own Trading Posts along the same Trade Route.\n \nBuilding a Trading Post along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or increase the speed at which shipments come from the Home City. The Trade Route starts with Travois moving along it, slowly delivering goods. The Travois can be replaced by a Stagecoach with an improvement available in a Trading Post built alongside the Trade Route.\n \nAnyone who has built a Trading Post along a Trade Route is granted line of sight around the Travois. This means that as the Travois passes into the Fog of War, or completely unexplored areas, you can see what is immediately beyond it.</string>
    <string _locid="100252">The travois is an elongated triangle frame designed to be dragged by humans, horses, or dogs. The long sides trail away from the puller and are sometimes held apart by a third support. It allows the transport of heavier loads than can be carried on a human's or an animal's back. Goods are tied to the travois or piled onto a cloth or leather tarp.\n \nNomadic Native Americans used travois to transport their homes. They dragged the travois themselves or harnessed dogs to it, or horses after the Spanish introduced them. Across rugged terrain, these travois often fared better than wheeled carts.</string>
    <string _locid="100253">Treasures are usually guarded by outlaws or predators. When these guardians are killed the Treasure yields resources, experience, or even Settlers or soldiers. Outlaws may have kidnapped Settlers; a predator may have treed a Native American scout; or perhaps there is a predator here that you can tame. When there are no more guardians, your Explorer or a gatherer can recover the Treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="100254">The New World was full of hazards for even the most prepared colonists. Some settlers arrived with shockingly little in the way of supplies. Carving a niche out of the rugged wilderness was only the beginning. They faced harsh weather, bold predators, starvation, and disease. Native Americans ranged from helpful to hostile, depending on how much and what kind of contact they had already had with other European settlers. Many colonies were simply abandoned, like Popham colony in Maine; its settlers returned to England after only a year. Some, like Roanoke, vanished completely, and no one knows what happened.</string>

    <string _locid="100255">The Arsenal does not have any units in it to train, but it has a lot of improvements in it for each of the three major unit lines - infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The improvements available in this building can shore up unit weaknesses, like giving artillery more hitpoints, or emphasize unit strengths, like giving Skirmishers and muskets better range.\n \nWhether you are building one or a mix of unit lines, the bonuses provided in the Arsenal can give your armies an edge. It should be noted that these improvements apply to Native American warriors and soldiers as well. The Advanced Arsenal card in the Home City adds additional improvements to the Arsenal.</string>
    <string _locid="100256">An arsenal is a storehouse for all manner of weapons and ordinance of war. Some arsenals were brick-and-mortar storehouses, guarded and protected. During the lead up to the American Revolutionary War, arsenals could be any stockpile of weapons, often hidden in attics and walls so that British soldiers could not find them. Artillery pieces were even taken apart and buried in fields to hide them, making "arsenals" out of entire towns.\n \nOn April 19, 1775, the British marched into Lexington hoping to chase down rebellion leaders and capture an insurgent arsenal. The British regulars outnumbered the revolutionaries 10 to 1 and ordered the gathered militia to stand down so that they could go about disbanding the militia and seizing or destroying any weapons cached in an arsenal.</string>
    <string _locid="100257">This is where light artillery, such as Falconets and Grenadiers, are produced in the New World. Artillery are some of the deadliest units available, so if you have built an Artillery Foundry, protect it. And if you see an enemy Foundry, destroy it!\n \nBecause artillery moves very slowly, it is best to build the Artillery Foundry as close to where it is needed as possible. If that is outside your colony, this can make it vulnerable to attacks, so place it carefully.</string>
    <string _locid="100258">The manufacture of artillery is a laborious process involving furnaces and cranes to move the heavy barrels through several stages of construction.</string>
    <string _locid="100259">The Bank is a unique Dutch building that generates Coin. It is a very expensive building, especially early, when the Food and Wood needed for its construction compete directly with Settler production and researching improvements or constructing buildings.\n \nOnly a limited number of Banks can be built in a single game, but Shipments from the Home City can increase that number.</string>
    <string _locid="100260">The seventeenth century saw the founding of the Wisselbank of Amsterdam. This financial institution rapidly became the wealthiest and most powerful bank in existence. They were the first to accept and actively promote the exchange of checks, and the government passed laws stating that large transactions between two parties had to be brokered by the Wisselbank. The successes of the Dutch East India Company kept Dutch coffers full and flowing, and the Dutch economy soared.\n \nTrade in tulips, iconically Dutch flowers, rose dramatically in the middle of the seventeenth century and crashed even more dramatically. A single tulip bulb at the height of the craze could purchase an entire estate. These bulbs were bought and sold on paper. This, with the practices of the Wisselbank of Amsterdam, put Holland on the cutting edge of finance. As prices skyrocketed, some people seeking to lock in their profits sold off their tulips at lower than peak prices, sending a ripple of fear through the market that grew to widespread panic as everyone began to realize these tulips, while beautiful, were just bulbs, cousins of the onion, and not worth a house, a life savings or even carriage with a pair of matched gray horses.</string>
    <string _locid="100261">The Barracks is the home for all manner of infantry units and the improvements that will increase the amount of damage they can take and dish out. Groups of up to five units can be trained at once from the Barracks. You can train as many units as you can afford, but each additional group stacks up behind the first.\n \nBarracks are relatively inexpensive, so it can be useful to build an additional Barracks to produce units faster, or have one on hand that focuses on improving your soldiers.</string>
    <string _locid="100262">Barracks were constructed in the British colonies when colonists tired of housing British regulars for two straight years during the French and Indian War. Hostilities escalated as increasing numbers of troops were sent to defend the Crown's interests. More and more settlers were required by law to provide shelter to the soldiers. Eventually the dissatisfaction amongst colonists grew so strong that Lord Loudoun, General in Chief of America, agitated for the construction of a number of barracks to house the soldiers.\n \nThe Third Amendment of the U.S. Constitution specifically prohibits the requirement by law for citizens to house soldiers.</string>
    <string _locid="100263">The Blockhouse is where all Russian infantry are trained. Russian infantry units (and only infantry units) are trained in blocks of no less than four, but up to ten or more. That means you have to pay for them all at once - but at a savings in overall cost. Though Russian infantry units aren't as strong as other infantry, what they lack in strength they make up for in quantity.\n \nThe Blockhouse is also a defensive building that fires at nearby enemies and can be upgraded in later Ages to the tougher and stronger Frontier Blockhouse.</string>
    <string _locid="100264">A blockhouse is a military building that is often fortified for protection. A blockhouse is similar to a fort, but while a fort has multiple buildings, a blockhouse has only one structure. In the New World, blockhouses were used for defense on the frontier. Russian blockhouses built along the west coast were hexagonal in shape and usually had multiple stories.</string>
    <string _locid="100265">The Capitol is available only when you reach the Imperial Age. It is the source of a number of very powerful improvements meant to make the side that can afford them so powerful that they can end an otherwise stalemated game. One improvement gives you line of sight to every unit in the game, including your enemies'! Another can stop an enemy player's Home City Shipments. Another raises the population limit on gatherers and soldiers.</string>
    <string _locid="100266">A capitol is a building or set of buildings that houses government offices, usually the legislative branch. Four buildings have served as capitol buildings in the United States. The first was the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland. That building still stands and is currently used to house the Maryland General Assembly.</string>
    <string _locid="100267">The Church and Mosque are where colonies train their healing units, Priests, Imams, or Missionaries. They are also a source of many unique upgrades either provided by your civilization or unlocked in your Home City and shipped to the New World. Some civilizations, particularly the Ottomans, get a lot of benefit from the improvements here.</string>
    <string _locid="100268">Churches are places of worship for Christian colonists. Settlers in the New World built churches to provide a place for worship as well as for community events. Religion drove exploration and colonization as people like the Pilgrims left their homes, fleeing persecution, to find religious freedoms in the New World.</string>
    <string _locid="100269">Docks can only be built along the shoreline. They train Fishing Boats, Canoes (if you are allied with Native Americans), Caravels, and a number of tougher ships of the line as they become available.\n \nIf your Fishing Boats come under attack and you can't fight your enemy off, you can hide your fishing fleet in the Dock. Fishing Boats garrisoned in a Dock cannot fish, but they give the Dock the ability to fire on enemy units - so not only are your boats safe, they can defend themselves as well. </string>
    <string _locid="100270">Docks provide places for ships to load and unload passengers and goods. A group of docks is referred to as a dockyard. Towns often grow up around docks because they provide a convenient means of trade. This trend is evident in the Northeast section of the United States.</string>
    <string _locid="100273">Factories are a powerful late-game building that can supply a constant stream of resources or heavy artillery. When you build a Factory you designate what resource (Food, Wood, or Coin) it will supply, and as long as the building stands, it will feed a steady trickle of that resource into your coffers. However, it is perhaps more fun to set your Factory to manufacturing cannon!\n \nMost factories make Heavy Cannon, but British Factories make Rockets and Ottoman Factories make Great Bombards. This is the only way to produce these powerful artillery pieces in the New World.</string>
    <string _locid="100274">A factory is a large building that produces goods on a large scale and is usually associated with machinery, division of labor, and workers who are paid a wage. The first known factory was the Venice Arsenal, which began mass-producing ships in 1104. Factories came into common use in the eighteenth century and as the Industrial Revolution gathered steam, so to speak, factories cropped up in urban areas all over the western world.</string>
    <string _locid="100275">Surgeons can build Field Hospitals, a special building that heals nearby untis. Surgeons are only available in the Home City, so if you want Field Hospitals you need to make sure you send a shipment of Surgeons. </string>
    <string _locid="100276">A field hospital is often the first stop for a wounded soldier. It provides treatment at the scene of battle to stabilize wounded people enough so that they can be escorted away from the battlefield to receive further treatment. Napoleon was the first leader to have dedicated medics on the field of battle; George Washington had litter-bearers on the field during the Revolutionary War.</string>
    <string _locid="100277">Forts are strong defensive buildings consisting of walls, towers, gates, and buildings within the Fort walls. Towers fire, so it is wise to attack forts with units that outrange the towers or that do a lot of siege damage. Artillery like Falconets and especially Mortars are good at destroying Forts.\n \nForts can only be built by Fort Wagons, which are sent from the Home City. You may have to unlock the ability to send them. Some civilizations have the ability to send more than one Fort Wagon.</string>
    <string _locid="100278">Forts in the New World ranged from wooden palisades assembled hastily as outposts or for the protection of watersheds to sprawling star forts whose distinctively angled earthen and stone walls protected key ports, mines, cities, and overland trade routes.\n \nFort McHenry, once called Fort Whetstone, was a star fort surrounded on three sides by water. In 1814 it survived a 25-hour bombardment by the British. Francis Scott Key wrote a poem about his experiences during and after the battle, and the story of Fort McHenry and its star-spangled banner became the national anthem of the United States in 1931.</string>
    <string _locid="100279">Gates are a passage through a wall that only you or your allies can use. If you see an enemy gate, it is likely that defenders will come from there, so plan for it.\n \nYou can change long wall segments into gates for a small cost by selecting a wall segment and clicking the Build Gate button.</string>
    <string _locid="100280">Early fortifications in the New World were palisades constructed of sharpened tree trunks driven into the ground side by side to form walls. Some of these palisade walls, especially when a little green, were remarkably effective at withstanding bombardment by artillery because they could flex as they were hit, rather than splintering, like dried wood, or shattering, like masonry walls.\n \nMore effective than either wood or stone at withstanding bombardment were the bermed earthworks famously ringing star forts like Fort McHenry. A fort in the era of cannon was a series of sculpted plains, ditches, bastions, and walls of earth and stone that maximized lines of sight and fire for defenders.</string>
    <string _locid="100281">Houses are necessary to support the expanding population of a growing colony. Most units that you can train take up a specific amount of population spaces or population slots. Each House, or Town Center, that you build raises the number of slots you have available, allowing you to train more and more units. There is a limit on the number of Houses you can build in a single game.\n \nEvery time you train a unit, the game checks to see if you have enough Houses to support the new soldiers or civilians. If you do not, you will not be able to train the units until you build a House or Town Center.</string>
    <string _locid="100282">Houses in the New World displayed varying styles, from the Cape-style houses of New England to the claim shanties in the West to the ranch houses in Texas and Mexico. Often the house style reflected the cultural heritage of the people who settled the land.\n \nOf course, Native Americans also had a wide variety of housing, including the tipis of the Plains tribes and the wattle-and-daub houses of the Cherokee.</string>
    <string _locid="100283">Livestock pens are a place to collect the Sheep, Cows, and Llamas you find while exploring or ship from the Home City. Sheep, Cows, and Llamas are special animals that "fatten" over time, meaning that the longer they are alive the more Food they provide when killed by gatherers. Herd animals that graze at a Livestock Pen fatten faster than they would on their own.\n \nSheep, Cows, and Llamas near a Livestock Pen automatically walk to it and get the benefits. You can manually put your herd animals in the pen by selecting them, and then right-clicking the building, much as a Settler gathers resources.</string>
    <string _locid="100284">Keeping animals was important to the founding of the New World, especially as areas became settled and hunting became less abundant. Animals were used for food, but they had other uses as well. Fat from animals was used to make soap, the skins were used for clothing, and tallow was used in candles. Tallow was also used to keep leather supple and water-resistant.</string>
    <string _locid="100285">Manor Houses are necessary to support the expanding population of a growing British colony. Most units that you can train take up a specific amount of population space, or population slots. Each Manor House or Town Center that you build raises the number of slots you have available, allowing you to train more and more units. There is a limit to the number of Manor Houses you can build in a single game.\n \nEvery time you train a unit, the game checks to see if you have enough Manor Houses to support the new soldiers or civilians. If you don't, you cannot train the units until you build another Manor House or Town Center.\n \nEach completed Manor House produces a single Settler.</string>
    <string _locid="100286">Houses in the New World displayed varying styles, from the Cape-style houses of New England to the claim shanties in the West to the ranch houses in Texas and Mexico. Often the house style reflected the cultural heritage of the people who settled in the land.\n \nOf course, Native Americans also had a wide variety of housing, including the tipis of the Plains tribes and the wattle-and-daub houses of the Cherokee.</string>
    <string _locid="100287">Markets are a place to improve your colony's gatherers, buy resources, or sell surplus resources. A number of economic improvements are available here in each Age that can affect the rate at which gatherers collect Wood, Food, and Coin, or even how hardy and resistant to attacks your gatherers are, though nothing makes them as effective in combat as even the weakest military unit.\n \nYou can buy or sell Wood and Food for the amount listed, and the Coin you earn or the Wood and Food you buy will show up in your resource stockpile. If you buy at the Market, you drive prices up; if you sell at the Market, you drive prices down. Any player can affect the prices listed, though you can only buy or sell resources at your own Market.</string>
    <string _locid="100288">A market provides a location to bring together buyers and sellers to trade. Ideally, prices are set by supply and demand. Markets were composed of stalls where vendors would sell their wares. Often people wouldn't pay with money, but would barter by offering a service in return for whatever they needed. As cities grew larger, stores replaced the open marketplaces, and money became a more common form of currency.</string>
    <string _locid="100289">Gatherers working at a Mill provide a steady stream of Food to your colony. Constructing a Mill costs a lot of Wood, so they are often built later in games, when nearby hunting has been exhausted, or by players who prefer to keep their gatherers close to the safety of the Town Center. Gathering Food at the Mill starts out slow, but you can improve Mills as the game progresses to make them a very efficient source of Food. Only a limited number of gatherers can work at each Mill.</string>
    <string _locid="100290">A mill is used to break grains down into smaller pieces making cooking and baking easier. They were historically powered by wind, water, or livestock. Grain is ground between stones, known as millstones, until it is fine enough to be used for whatever purpose is needed. Flour for bread was made in this manner.</string>
    <string _locid="100640">A Mosque is a place of worship for people of the Islamic faith. The first Mosque was located in the holy city of Mecca. Followers of Islam, called Muslims, are required to pray five times a day. It is preferable that these prayers be performed in a mosque, but they can be performed anywhere if there is no mosque nearby.</string>
    <string _locid="100291">The Outpost is a strong defensive building with a lot of hitpoints, good line of sight, and a good attack. They can be upgraded to Frontier Outposts that are significantly tougher and stronger. Outposts are useful for defending territory, whether in your colony, near Trading Posts and Native settlements, or other strategic map locations.\n \nThere is a limit to the number of Outposts you can build in a single game, though that number can be increased by certain shipments from the Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="100292">Outposts are buildings that are used to gain territory in a military conflict. One example of their use is in the disputed territory of Clipperton Island. The Island was originally charted by Magellan in 1521. It changed hands between Spain, France, and the United States. Eventually, Mexico claimed it and built an outpost to reinforce their claim. Even with the outpost, though, Clipperton Island continued to change hands well into the twentieth century.</string>
    <string _locid="100293">Gatherers working at an Estate provide a steady stream of Coin to your colony. Estates are often built later in games, when nearby mining has been exhausted, or by players who prefer to keep their gatherers close to the safety of the Town Center. Gathering Coin at the Estate starts out slow, but you can improve the Estate as the game progresses to make it a very efficient source of Coin. Only a limited number of gatherers can work at each Estate.</string>
    <string _locid="100294">An Estate is a large land holding where crops are cultivated. They were common across the United States as well as parts of the Caribbean.</string>
    <string _locid="100295">The Stable is the home for cavalry units and the improvements that increase the amount of damage they can sustain and inflict. Groups of up to five units can be trained at once from the Stable. You can train as many units as you can afford, but each additional group stacks up behind the first.\n \nStables are relatively inexpensive, so you may want to build an additional Stable to produce units faster, or have one dedicated to improving your soldiers.</string>
    <string _locid="100296">A stable is a building in which animals (typically horses) are housed.  Horses were vital to survival in the New World and every inn, home, and town had to have stables to shelter these important animals. Horses were used for travel, plowing fields, and for warfare up until the mid-twentieth century.\n \nThe Quartering Acts, passed by British Parliament in 1765, allowed British soldiers to occupy living space in just about any building they deemed suitable for housing.</string>
    <string _locid="100297">The Town Center is the heart of any colony. Gatherers are trained here. Home City shipments arrive here. The improvements that advance your colony in Age are here. Town Centers provide population spaces, or slots, for your total population limit. In the Fortress Age, a Covered Wagon Shipment sent from the Home City delivers a Covered Wagon. These wagons can build more Town Centers, but are available only in limited numbers and only from the Home City.\n \nIf your town comes under attack, there is a Militiamen button in the Town Center that drums up the militia for your town's defense, though this should be only an emergency measure, as the Militiamen are not meant for regular soldiering. There is also a button called the Town Bell that calls all your gatherers to the Town Center to hide from attacks. While inside, the gatherers fire at any attackers nearby. Hitting the town bell button again sends your gatherers back to work.</string>
    <string _locid="100298">Churches, taverns, and town halls were all important colonial centers where leaders and citizens met to discuss the issues facing their towns and colonies. Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia was the site of several important events in the history of the American colonies. One, the First Continental Congress, was the meeting of the thirteen colonies in the fall of 1774 to discuss their grievances with British governance and just what they could do about it.\n \nThis historic hall also housed Benjamin Franklin's Library Company and the First and Second Banks of the United States.</string>
    <string _locid="100299">The Trading Post can only be built on certain places on a given map. These places are special sites located near Native American settlements or along Trade Routes. An Explorer or a Settler can build the Trading Post on one of these pre-placed sites. If built at a Native settlement, it establishes an alliance with the tribe there. If built near a Trade Route, it establishes a post where the passing trade unit - a Travois, Stage Coach, or Train - delivers goods as it passes.\n \nAllying with Natives allows a player to train special Native units, usually warriors, and also grants access to a group of improvements to that tribe. Native units do not cost any population spaces, but can only be built in limited numbers.\n \nBuilding a Trading Post along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or the speed at which you may request Shipments from the Home City. An improvement in the Trading Post increases the speed at which the trade unit delivers goods. The route starts out serviced by a lone Travois; as you improve it, it becomes a Stage Coach and finally a Train.\n \nAnyone who has built a Trading Post along a Trade Route is granted line of sight around the trade unit. This means that as the trade unit passes into the Fog of War or completely unexplored areas, you will be able to see what is immediately beyond the Train.</string>
    <string _locid="100300">Trading posts were established by early explorers of the New World as places to stop, barter, rest, and engage in commercial activities in support of their efforts to find wealth for their patrons, usually kings and queens, who sponsored their voyages.\n \nWealthy and powerful trading companies between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries competed viciously as they drove exploration of the New World in search of pelts (chiefly beaver), to market in Europe. They dotted the landscape with trading posts and continued driving west in search of new sources of pelts. The fur trade and the need for the trading posts declined as fashions in Europe changed and the demand for pelts collapsed. Many trading posts developed into proper settlements over time.</string>
    <string _locid="100320">Walls are a defensive building placed in a ring or arc to enclose and protect units, or placed across a narrow gap to restrict enemy movement through an area. They are relatively cheap to build and effective at keeping out early attacks, but when artillery show up, walls become significantly less of an obstacle. The lesson: if you want walls, try to build them early. If you see your enemy has extensive walls, artillery are a good means to destroy them.</string>
    <string _locid="100321">Early fortifications in the New World were palisades constructed of the sharpened trunks of trees, which were driven into the ground side by side to form walls. Some of these palisade walls, especially when a little green, were remarkably effective at withstanding bombardment by artillery because they could flex as they were hit instead of splintering like properly dried wood or shattering like masonry walls.\n \nMore effective than either wood or stone at withstanding bombardment were the bermed earthworks famously ringing star forts like Fort McHenry. A fort in the era of cannon was a series of sculpted plains, ditches, bastions, and walls of earth and stone that maximized line of sight and fire for defenders.</string>
    <string _locid="100301">Villagers working at a Tribal Marketplace provide a steady stream of Coin to your settlement. Tribal Marketplace are economic buildings that must be built near a mining resources.</string>
    <string _locid="100302">The Lakota traded buffalo (bison) hides and meats with other tribes and also with the non-Indigenous settlers of the Great Plains. Buffalo was very important to the Lakota because they used nearly every part of the animal to supply their needs, and it was also one of their main sources of food. They created a preserved cake called pemmican‚Äîa mixture of dried buffalo meat, fat and wild berries or fruit. Buffalo bones were used to make their utensils, and the skins were utilized for tipis, clothes, and bedding. Even buffalo bladders were put to a practical use: they served as water containers supported on wooden tripods (look for one in the Lakota Home City).\n\nThe Haudenosaunee primarily traded tobacco, pelts and wampum (a traditional shell bead currency of the Northeastern Woodland nations of North America). Like the Lakota, the Haudenosaunee also traded with neighboring tribes; and after the arrival of Europeans, they began to trade fur and tobacco with them, acquiring metal items like knives, axe-heads and cooking pots as well as firearms.</string>
    <string _locid="100323">The Amazon basin is drained by over a thousand tributaries that empty into the massive Amazon River, which in turn dumps millions of gallons of fresh water into the ocean per second. The Amazon River is over 6,000 miles long and more than 24 miles wide at its widest point. An astonishing variety of plants and animals live in the rain forest, including capybara, sloths, macaws and millions of insect species, all living in different strata of the forest, from the tops of the tall trees to the dirt and streams below, and everywhere in between.\n \nThe Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Orellana was the first European to successfully navigate the length of the Amazon River. Virtually all of his men died in the voyage; when he returned to Spain, Orellana told of attacks on his men by a group of fierce warrior women. In reality, the attackers were probably long-haired men. He likened his assailants to the Amazon women of Greek mythology and the name stuck.</string>
    <string _locid="100325">Bayous stretch the southern shores of North America from Texas to Mississippi. They are home to hosts of wildlife and plants, all living in or near the sluggishly moving waters of bayou streams. They are often formed when a tributary of a river gets cut off from the main flow of fresh water. Crawfish, nutria, and alligators are just a few famous bayou animals. Marsh-loving trees include willows, cypress, and tupelo.\n \nThe bayou's best-known inhabitants are the Cajuns. Formerly French settlers who were exiled over several decades from their lands in Canada, the Cajuns (originally Acadians) settled in what is now southern Louisiana. They were driven away for a time by Charles Lawrence, who in 1753 became the governor of Acadia, recently claimed by the British. Over the next several decades they were captured, imprisoned, fled, and resettled in areas all over Canada, the West Indies, and what would become North America.</string>
    <string _locid="100327">The Caribbean Sea is a western offshoot of the Atlantic Ocean that sits between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Though many of the islands are south of the Tropic of Cancer, the waters around such islands as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are cooler than mainland Central America. These islands are subtropical rather than tropical, even though they are well within the tropics. Islands are mountainous, formed millions of years ago in volcanic eruptions from the sea floor. Plant and animal life is abundant and diverse, in areas ranging from deserts to rainforests.\n \nIslands in the eastern waters (the West Indies) were the site of Christopher Columbus' first landfall in the Western Hemisphere. The Spanish established dozens of colonies and ports in this area to support their conquest of wealthy natives, especially the Inca, Maya, and Aztec. The islands of the Caribbean were already settled by a fierce people, the Carib, who eventually supported the sugar plantations and colonies of a number of European powers. The French, British, and Dutch all had a presence in the Caribbean, though none were quite as powerful as the Spanish. Fat Spanish galleons loaded with plundered gold and silver sailed the length of the Caribbean, tempting attacks by privateers and pirates.</string>
    <string _locid="100329">From the Smoky and Blue Ridge mountains in the west, to the Piedmont grassland plateaus of the midlands, to the coastal plains of the east, the Carolinas support a wide variety of plant and animal life. There are wetland marshes, hardwood forests, and piney mountain slopes. South Carolina is called the Palmetto State, after the Palmetto tree that flourishes along the coast. Other common trees are the long-leaf pine, which provided many of the region's early economic wealth, turpentine, resin, and timber.\n \nThe earliest known European settlement of the Carolinas was by the Spanish in 1526. It was followed by a French Huguenot settlement and further Spanish mission settlements radiating up from Florida. In the middle of the seventeenth century, England began to make more aggressive claims to the area; and by the end of the seventeenth century, the area was thoroughly British. North and South Carolina, like other royal colonies, joined the American Revolution in response to the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts. Plantations worked by African and Native American slaves produced rice, indigo, cotton, and especially tobacco.</string>
    <string _locid="100331">The five Great Lakes ‚Äì Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario - span over a 1,000 miles of the border between the United States and Canada. Water flows west to east from lake to lake, dropping 170 feet at the Niagara Falls between lakes Erie and Ontario before flowing into the St. Lawrence River and out finally to the North Atlantic.\n \nThe names of the Great Lakes varied over the years from simple or colorful names or names that referenced Native American tribes nearby. Lac de Chat (or Lake of the Cat), was a French name for Lake Erie, probably in reference to the wildcats found in the area; the name "Erie" refers to a tribe of Native Americans that lived in the area. Lake Michigan had an unfortunate early name, "The Stinking Water Lake," but later came to be called Michigan after the Native American name for the lake, "michi gami."</string>
    <string _locid="100333">The Great Plains are a broad, grassy, sloping expanse of prairie land that extends from Texas in the south to the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba in the north. The climate is semi-arid and the dominant vegetation of the region is a large variety of tall and short grasses. Trees and woody plants tend to grow only along streams and rivers. The area was once home to millions of bison (and dozens of Native American tribes who followed and relied on the herds) that were systematically hunted to near extinction for their hides and tongues. The bison were gone, and the Native Americans were forcibly removed to reservations or driven away.\n \nThe Homestead Act of 1862 promised 160 acres to anyone who could settle and live on their claim for five years. Settlers had to be 21 years old, the head of a family, or a citizen (or in the process of filing for citizenship). The arid region wasn't especially suited to farming and the going was rough for many homesteaders. Those immigrants who came from the grassy steppes of eastern Europe and western Russia fared better than others, but many faced such hardships that they gave up their claims and returned east.</string>
    <string _locid="100335">Comprising six states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut) in the northeastern United States, New England is bound in the west by the Appalachian Mountains. Rocky coastal plains extend to the shore and are not especially suited to farming. The forests and trees of New England are known for their spectacular fall color. A wide variety of trees contribute to the colorful display -  birches, basswoods, and aspens put on bright yellow colors; red oaks, sugar maples, and tupelos put on red foliage.\nEuropean settlers to the area concentrated on fishing and whaling when they found the thin soil poor and largely unsuited to cultivation. However, they found an abundance of wild game and wild food sources, many of them pointed out to the early settlers by friendly Native Americans in the area. Of the six New England states, four of them were among the original thirteen colonies. Vermont became the fourteenth state and Maine became the twenty-third state after separating from Massachusetts.</string>
    <string _locid="100337">The Pampas is a grassy plains area in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. The grasslands drain from west to east, sloping away from the Andes to the west. The fertile soil supports farming and pastureland for cattle. Cattle were introduced by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century and tended by Argentines and Brazilians called gauchos. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, gauchos were romanticized figures, hardy and lean poets of the grasslands. They are the cowboys of South America.\n \nTrees are scarce in the plains of the Pampas, growing chiefly along streams and rivers. The only tree native to the Pampas is the ombu, a massive trunk with softwood that holds moisture well. Poisonous sap keeps grazing animals from browsing on its saplings, which grow into forty-foot-tall spreading canopies of dark green leaves that provide much-needed shade to the grassy landscape.</string>
    <string _locid="100339">On the southern tip of South America, Patagonia is a dry, windy plateau crisscrossed by rocky valleys and stepped shelves of land that slope down from the Andes in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. Pumas (cougars) and humans are the dominant predators of the region, though there are a number of smaller predators, including red and gray foxes and predatory birds.\n \nPlant species vary from grasses and small, hardy shrubs on the plains to evergreen pines and hardwoods on the mountainous slopes of the Andes. The Tehuelches are a native people of Patagonia, rumored by many early European explorers to be giants. They are, in fact, a tall people with the southern Tehuelches generally taller than the northern Tueheulches. All of these sturdy people were probably taller than the Europeans, whose average height in the centuries they first encountered the Tehuelches was several inches shorter than it is today.</string>
    <string _locid="100341">The Rockies stretch 3,000 miles from Alaska and Canada to the southern border of the western United States. The tallest peak is Mount Elbert in Colorado, at 14,433 feet. Mountain goats, elk, grizzlies, coyotes, and porcupines are just a few of the animals that live in the Rocky Mountains. Trees vary widely across the entire range and include junipers, oaks, willows, firs, spruces, and pines.\n \nEarly European explorers to the area included Coronado in his search for the Seven Cities of Gold and Lewis and Clark with their Corps of Discovery. Settlers crossed the forbidding range at a number of places. The South Pass in southwestern Wyoming was used by many settlers headed to California, Oregon, and Utah following the Oregon and Mormon trails. Kicking Horse in Canada has a number of passes. The Santa Fe Trail uses a pass on the southern trailing edge of the Rockies that became a very popular western route during the gold rush of the mid-nineteenth century.</string>
    <string _locid="100343">Saguenay is both a river and a region, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, situated on the Canadian Shield, a huge plateau of nearly bare rock and rocky soil. This is a wild and beautiful area of rugged mountainous terrain and, where the Saguenay River cuts through breathtaking fjords. The Saguenay River empties into the St. Lawrence River at the site of the early 16th century French trading post Tadoussac.\n \nSaguenay was the name of a mythical kingdom of gold and treasures, one of dozens that early explorers believed the New World held. It is certainly a land of natural treasures and beautiful vistas. Caribou, wolves, foxes, hawks, and moose all live in the Saguenay region. The cold waters are home to beluga whales, minke whales, and harbor seals.</string>
    <string _locid="100345">Sonora is a mountainous region in northwestern Mexico that is bordered by the Gulf of California in the west, by California and Arizona to the north, and by the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sinaloa to the east and south. Broad expanses of cactus desert stretch throughout the region. Grassy coastal plains support cattle and heavily irrigated grain and cotton farming. The mountains have many species of cactus (and, in fact, more varieties of vegetation than any other desert on Earth) that thrive in the Sonoran desert. The most of these is the massive saguaro cactus. Roadrunners, rattlesnakes, tarantulas, and hummingbirds make their homes in this arid, hostile environment.\n \nWhen they entered this mountainous desert in the early sixteenth century, the Spanish encountered the native Yaqui and others who fiercely defended their lands. The efforts of Father Eusebio Kino and other missionaries in the seventeenth century promoted European settlement in the area by converting the natives to Christianity. Father Kino promoted peaceful relations with and development of the Native Americans he encountered. While he was not particularly interested in preserving their culture, he tried to protect the Sonoran natives from exploitation and slavery by the Spanish.</string>
    <string _locid="100347">Texas is the second-largest state in the U.S. after Alaska. It has many regions and climates, ranging from pine forests and bayous to grassy plains and deserts. Wildlife is just as varied: deer, bats, pronghorn, goats, mountain lions, horned lizards, and coyotes are just some of the wild animals of Texas. Rice, wheat, and cotton are some of Texas' most abundant crops, and the grasslands, the southernmost edge of the Great Plains, support pasture lands for cattle and livestock.\n \nMany Indigenous American nations called the vast areas of Texas home, including the Comanche, Apache, Caddo, Kiowa, Cherokee, and Waco. The flags of six European nations have flown over the state of Texas, starting with the Spanish in the early sixteenth century. The French in the late seventeenth century claimed part of Texas near the gulf coast border with Louisiana. The French claim didn't last as the Spanish reasserted their claim by spreading missions and settlements all over the state. After Mexico won its independence from Spain, the Mexican flag flew over Texas. Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836 and developed its own flag. In 1845, Texas was finally allowed to enter the United States, but it sided with the Confederacy during the American Civil War.</string>
    <string _locid="100349">The Yucatan peninsula is bordered on the north and west by the Gulf of Mexico and on the east by the Caribbean Sea. The peninsula is a large shelf of land that projects eastward out of the main body of Central America. The entire region is hot, with northern areas drier than the southern areas. Turkeys, jaguars, coatimundis, and tapirs are found among the palms, mangroves, and wide variety of broadleaf vegetation found in the tropical rainforests.\n \nThe thick canopy of the tropical forests is broken by the jutting of man-made stone mountains - the ruins of the ancient Maya civilization. One of the most remarkable sites is the city of Chichen Itza, mysteriously abandoned by the Maya around 1400 CE after 1,000 years of settlement and about 100 years before their first encounters with the Spanish. During the spring and fall equinox, at the great pyramid in the middle of Chichen Itza, a shadow appears on the tall steps, appearing like a serpent ascending the stairs. Little is known about why the Maya suddenly abandoned this city.</string>
    <string _locid="100351">The Yukon is sandwiched between Alaska to the west and the Canadian northwest territories in the east. It has long winters and short summers, when hardy grains and flowering plants thrive briefly. The sparsely limbed sub-alpine fir is well adapted to the heavy snows of the Yukon winter. Grizzly bears, black bears, and polar bears all live in the Yukon. Caribou, moose, elk, musk ox, and red deer all thrive in the frozen terrain despite predation by wolves.\n \nThe first non-natives to explore the Yukon were Russians. (actually the first was a Dane in the Russian Navy, Vitus Bering, who was exploring the western coast of North America). In the late nineteenth century, gold was discovered in Rabbit Creek, now Bonanza Creek, which became the heart of the Klondike or Yukon gold rush. More than 25,000 eager prospectors descended on the inhospitable place to strike it rich. It was only a few years before easily accessible gold deposits were exhausted and the boom ended.</string>
    <string _locid="100352">A cache of resources that gatherers can collect very quickly. Crates of Food, Cords of Wood, and Chests of Coin are generally delivered from the Home City to Town Centers or Outposts. They provide resources very quickly, but in a very limited amount. Any player can gather from any crate, which means allies can share them or enemies can steal them if they are left unattended at a Town Center. Guard crates carefully, or better yet, use them as soon as possible!</string>
    <string _locid="100353">This animal can be fished for Food by gatherers such as Fishing Boats and Caravels.</string>
    <string _locid="100354">This predator is guarding a New World Treasure. In order to collect the Treasure, which may be resources, experience points, or even Settlers or soldiers, the predator or predators guarding it must be killed.

    <string _locid="100355">These herdable animals can be hunted for Food by gatherers - Coureur des Bois, Cree Coureurs, Settlers, and Settler Wagons. Unlike wild animals, these animals can be captured and sent back to your colony. If they are alone traveling back to your colony, another player may stumble across them and steal them away from you.\n \nHerdable animals "fatten" over time, so the longer they are alive, the more Food they will provide when your gatherers finally hunt them. They will fatten even faster at a Livestock Pen.</string>

    <string _locid="100359">Scientific Name: Alligator mississippiensis\nApprox. Size: 9 ft. long; 200 lb.\nDiet: Fish, frogs, snails, mammals\n \nAlligators are distinguished from crocodiles by a number of features. An alligator's eyes do not face forward as much as a crocodiles'. Both the upper and lower teeth are visible when a crocodile shuts its mouth; an alligator's closed mouth reveals only upper teeth. The easiest and most reliable method to distinguish between the two is the alligator's broad snout. Alligators range throughout the southeastern portion of North America. Female alligators lay dozens of eggs and cover them with vegetation to keep them warm. The temperature of the eggs as they incubate determines the gender of the babies that hatch.\n \nAdult alligators dig holes by thrashing their bodies and digging with claws and snout. The purpose of these holes is to ensure that the alligator has a place to shelter during the hottest part of summer and droughts. It can also provide water for other animals during especially dry seasons, which, not coincidentally  provides food for the enterprising alligator. The word alligator comes from a corruption of the Spanish word for the animal they encountered in the Florida wetlands, "el lagarto" - the lizard.</string>

(male)\nDiet: Fish, squid, worms\n \nThe beluga is a small white whale with no dorsal fin. Their scientific name means "white dolphin without a wing."  Beluga whales eat a variety of fish and invertebrates that they hunt and catch. Up to half of an adult beluga's weight is fat, depending on the season. Certain groups of belugas are thought to shed their skin in warmer river estuaries by rolling themselves on rocky underwater outcroppings. Their skin is 100 times thicker than a human's. It contains a large store of vitamin C, serves as insulation, and helps cushion the whales from sharp ice and icebergs in the coldest arctic waters.\n \nInuit people relied heavily on the beluga for food, oil, leather, and raw materials for crafts and tools. The return of belugas to waters near Inuit settlements was an event to celebrate. Many hunters and many boats, kayaks, were used to hunt a single beluga whale. Virtually every part of the whale was used.</string>
    <string _locid="100362">This berry bush provides Food when any gatherer works on it - Settlers, Coureurs des Bois, Settler Wagons, and Cree Coureurs. The Food is slow and limited, but safe to collect since the bushes grow near Town Centers.</string>
    <string _locid="100363">There are many varieties of berries native to the Americas. Tart cranberries grow in cranberry bogs, flooded at harvest time to float the ripe berries to the surface where they are skimmed off and dried or put into preserves. Thorny blackberry bushes grow wild in the southern United States. The Guarana berry grows in the northeastern parts of South America and is named after the Guarani tribe.</string>
    <string _locid="100364">Scientific Name: Ovis canadensis\nApprox. Size: 200 lb. (female); 300 lb. (male)\nDiet: Grasses, shrubs\n \nBoth the males and females of this stocky mountain-dwelling sheep have horns, but the male has an impressive set of curling horns that sweep back from just above their ears. These horns, which can weigh as much as 40 lb. are part of the spectacular rutting jousts performed by the males. The thunder of two sheep crashing their horns together can be heard over a mile away.\n \nThe bighorn sheep's predators include coyotes and cougars. Their lambs are hunted by golden eagles. Human hunters prize bighorn sheep for their horns.</string>
    <string _locid="100365">Scientific Name: Bison bison\nApprox. Size: 5 ft. at the shoulder, 2,000 lb.\nDiet: Prairie grasses\n \nBison are massive, shaggy cattle that once inhabited the central plains of North America in the hundreds of millions. The Native Americans of the plains relied heavily on the migrating herds. Native Americans, grizzly bears, and, later, European settlers were the only hunters capable of slaying bison. Bison have huge heads with short curved horns and a large, heavily furred hump at their shoulders.\n \nCalfs born with white fur are very rare; they are significant in Native American traditions and are greeted with ceremony and prayer.</string>
    <string _locid="100366">Scientific Name: Ursus americanus\nApprox. Size: 130 lb. (female); 380 lb. (male)\nDiet: Fruits, grasses, roots, nuts, herbs, insects, fish, carrion\n \nThe black bear is the most common bear in North America. They live in a variety of habitats, preferring forests with an abundance of undergrowth that provides them with food, shelter, and protection from their rare, but fearsome, predators. Black bears scale trees to escape threats. Humans and other bears, even other black bears, are the chief predator of black bears.\n \nIn colder climates, the black bear enters true hibernation, but in warmer ranges the bears do not reach the depth of hibernating sleep, though they will sleep for extended periods of time in the cold months.\n \nThere are sixteen subspecies of black bear. One, the Ursus americanus kermodei, is a white, but not albino, subspecies that lives in the Pacific Northwest and is referred to as a Spirit Bear in some native traditions. Ursus americanus emmonsii, the glacier bear, has gray and white hairs in its coat giving a striking blue appearance to its coat.</string>
    <string _locid="100367">Scientific Name: Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris\nApprox. Size: 4 ft. long, 80 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, bark, river plants\n \nThe name capybara is a Tupi-Guarani word that means "grass eater." The capybara is the largest living rodent. It has sparse, bristly fur and partially webbed feet. They are excellent swimmers and can even sleep underwater, so long as their noses are above the surface. They live in herds that keep to riverbanks and water, hiding from predators by swimming away when they can. Catholic settlers in South America found the capybara and wondered if it was permissible to eat the strange water-loving animal during Lent (a time when no meat can be eaten, but fish is acceptable). The Church, fearing the loss of such distant and endangered followers, classified the capybara as a fish, a decision that has never been reversed.</string>
    <string _locid="100368">Scientific Name: Rangifer tarandus\nApprox. Size: 44 in. at the shoulder (male), 275 lb. \nDiet: Sedges, evergreen leaves, especially lichen\n \nThe caribou or reindeer is a large antlered herd animal that frequents high latitudes. The word caribou may have originated from a Micmac word that means "pawer." Caribou are unique among deer in that both males and females have antlers. Caribou migrate a great distance seasonally to calving grounds. They are also capable swimmers. They have long legs, with sharp hooves and hairy toes to provide traction over frozen ground. Caribou are generally silent, but their tendons make sharp clicking sounds that can be heard for a long distance when the animals travel in large groups.\n \nCaribou are preyed upon by bears and wolves; Caribou calves are preyed upon by golden eagles.</string>
    <string _locid="100369">Scientific Name: Felis concolor\nApprox. Size: 7 ft. long, 170 lb.\nDiet: Large and small mammals\n \nAlso commonly called mountain lion, puma, or panther, the cougar has a tawny, red or gray coat and pale belly. Before European settlement of the New World, cougars and their relatives ranged the length and breadth of North and South America, and though their territory is much smaller now, they have one of the largest ranges of any animal in the New World. They chiefly hunt large mammals, but eat smaller game in the absence of larger game.</string>
    <string _locid="100370">Scientific Name: Bos taurus\nApprox. Size: 5 ft. at the shoulder, 1,200 lb.\nDiet: Grasses\n \nCattle accompanied Europeans to the Americas. Spanish expeditions often traveled with herds of oxen, cattle, sheep, and pigs in tow. The famous Texas Longhorn was bred from Spanish cattle brought from Santo Domingo, though who brought them is unclear. The original herd is said to have accompanied a viceroy, Gregorio de Villalobos, but other Spanish longhorn cattle drives are attributed to Coronado and even Christopher Columbus.\n \nMost of the cattle that lived in the central plains of North America, the herds that sparked range wars and gave birth to cowboys, came from the breeding of these Spanish longhorns and the northern European cattle brought east by other settlers.</string>
    <string _locid="100371">Scientific Name: Canis latrans\nApprox. Size: 20 in. at the shoulder, 30 lb.\nDiet: Large and small mammals, carrion, garbage\n \nThe coyote is a small, grayish-brown, wolf-like canine that inhabits deserts, prairies, and other grasslands, but can survive close proximity with humans. Clearing of forest lands in some areas has actually expanded the range of coyotes. Because coyotes are smart and adaptable, they are learning how to live alongside humans. They communicate with long, wavering howls and sharp yips that individuals vocalize on top of one another. This can make an eerie cacophony, haunting and beautiful in its own way.</string>
    <string _locid="100372">Supplies from Europe were vital to the survival of a struggling colony in the New World. The colony at Roanoake had the misfortune of being established during a time of drought in the area, leading to difficulties in growing food. In addition, the colony's relationship with the Native American people in the area was not good. The colonists had so many difficulties that they left the colony before a desperately needed supply ship could arrive.\n \nWhen the supply ship finally arrived it found the colony abandoned. Fifteen men from the ship decided to stay behind while the ship returned to England. When another ship made the crossing to rescue the men left behind they found no sign of them except for the bones of one of them. No one knows for certain what happened to the others.</string>
    <string _locid="100373">Scientific Name: Odocoileus virginianus\nApprox. Size: 120 lb. (hind); 220 lb. (stag)\nDiet: Buds, leaves, ferns, grasses\n \n"Deer" is used as a generic term for any hoofed animal with antlers, but also refers to a specific species within that group. Like all of these species, except caribou, only male deer have antlers. The white-tailed deer is found from southern Canada to as far south as Panama. They live in small groups and are seasonally territorial.</string>
    <string _locid="100374">Scientific Name: Cervus elaphus\nApprox. Size: 250 lb. (hind); 500 lb. (stag)\nDiet: Grasses, sedges, woody growth\n \nElk are large deer with shaggy manes and pointed horns. The Shawnee word for them is "Wapiti." They live in northern forests in large herds of up to 400 individuals, dominated by a matriarch. Stags form harems in the fall mating season. Stags are preyed upon by mountain lions, wolves, and bears.</string>
    <string _locid="100375">Scientific Name: Gadus morhua\nApprox. Size: Up to 6 1/2 ft.\nDiet: Small fish, mollusks, crabs, squid\n \nThe cod is an important food fish that lives in the North Atlantic and was a great source of economic wealth in northeastern North America. Hake and haddock are included in the species commonly called "cod," though there are dozens of fish that claim the name, some improperly. Cod are bottom feeders with a ventral fin located farther up on their bellies than most.\n \nScrod refers to a specific preparation of haddock or young cod where the fish is cut into thin strips for cooking. Current American and Canadian cod populations are overfished and may not recover as their habitat changes to exclude them.</string>
    <string _locid="100376">Scientific Name: Salmo salar\nApprox. Size: 48 in. long\nDiet: Fish, especially herring, smelts, alewives\n \nAtlantic salmon return from the ocean to fresh water to reproduce, nearly always to the same river where they were hatched. As spawning time nears, the male's head changes shape, developing a pronounced hook on the lower jaw. While Pacific salmon die after reproducing, Atlantic salmon can spawn more than once.\n \nSalmon stay in fresh water for the first 2-3 years of life before moving offshore. They are able to withstand cold temperatures in fresh or salt water. Adult salmon are eaten by seals, sharks, whales, and humans.</string>
    <string _locid="100377">Scientific Name: Ursus arctos subsp. horribilis\nApprox. Size: 500 lb. (female); 900 lb. (male)\nDiet: Roots, fungi, fish, insects, large and small mammals\n \nA subspecies of the largest species of bear, the brown bear, grizzlies get their name from the white tips of their fur that give them a rough, weathered appearance. The hump of muscle, visible in profile, between the grizzly's shoulders is massive, giving incredible strength to their forequarters and allowing them to dig and strike powerfully. Their claws are three to four inches long and not many mammals can withstand the powerful strike of a grizzly bear. They spend the better part of the fall season fattening up for the lean winter months when they become sluggish if not actually hibernating. Grizzlies find or excavate dens for the winter, usually just large enough for themselves, with an entry that will let air circulate.\n \nGrizzly bears once ranged throughout North America west of the Mississippi and as far south as Mexico. Today they live in rugged, remote mountains and forest wilderness areas..</string>

    <string _locid="100379">Scientific Name: Equus caballus\nApprox. Size: 5 ft. at the shoulder, 1,000 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, feed\n \nHorses are long-legged, single-toed mammals that rely on speed and awareness to flee predators. They are social animals, living in herds led by matriarchs. Horses use elaborate body language to communicate with one another, which humans can learn and use to better communicate with horses. Though domesticated, horses are prey animals and their cooperation with man must be learned. There are many characteristics that define various breeds: color, gait, temperament, and size are just a few. Almost all modern horse breeds trace their ancestry back to Arabian horses.\n \nWhen the Europeans arrived in the New World, they brought horses. Many Indigenous American nations saw and embraced the power and utility of horses. Equus is thought to have evolved in North America millions of years ago, spreading to other parts of the world. Around 10,000 years ago they mysteriously vanished from North America and were unknown on the continent until Europeans reintroduced them.</string>
    <string _locid="100380">Scientific Name: Panthera onca\nApprox. Size: Up to 7 ft. long, 200 lb.\nDiet: Deer, cattle, peccary, capybara, monkeys, fish\n \nJaguars are often confused with leopards, another tawny, spotted cat. A distinguishing feature of the jaguar is that their spots have small black dots or irregular shapes within the rosette patterns. Jaguars are also stockier and have larger heads than leopards. Both jaguars and leopards have melanistic, or black, variants. Without spots, black jaguars can be differentiated from black leopards primarily by their stocky build. Both big cats, whether jaguars or leopards, black or spotted, are commonly, if mistakenly, called panthers.\n \nHistorically, jaguars ranged from the southern parts of North America down to the southern most tip of South America, but their ranges now are in central and northern South America. Jaguars enjoy a rare, unchallenged perch at the top of the wild food chain. In their South American habitat, they have no predators and few real competitors, apart from humans.</string>
    <string _locid="100381">Scientific Name: Tayassu tajacu\nApprox. Size: 22 ft. at the shoulder, 50 lb.\nDiet: Roots, insects, reptiles, fruit\n \nAlso called the collared peccary, the javelina is a small, wild piglike animal whose bristly coat is grayish brown with a white mantle from shoulder to chest. The name "peccary" is an evolution of the Carib word "pekira." Javelinas have downturned tusks they use primarily for fighting. Comfortable in a variety of terrains, the javelina ranges from the southwest of North America as far south as Argentina. They form small herds of six to twenty-four, though some species, like the white-lipped peccary, form large herds of up to 100 individuals.\n \nCougars, jaguars, coyotes, and wild dogs prey on javelinas, though bold javelinas aggressively defend themselves, grunting and making a clattering sound with their tusks to warn off or intimidate predators.</string>
    <string _locid="100382">Scientific Name: Lama glama\nApprox. Size: 3-4 ft. at the shoulder, 300 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, vegetation\n \nLlamas resemble shaggy camels without humps. They live in herds and are sometimes added to herds of sheep, goats, and even geese to protect these animals from predators. Humans use them as beasts of burden or sources of meat, milk, and wool. When aggravated or making displays of dominance or displeasure, llamas can spit up greenish stomach acid. They have thick, wooly coats, commonly brown, black and white or piebald. Llamas include four species of related animals - two (the llama and the alpaca) are domestic, and two (the guanaco and the vicuna) are wild.</string>
    <string _locid="100383">In 1848, the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in what would soon be California kicked off a gold rush that brought tens of thousands of hopeful prospectors across the wild frontiers of America. The influx of prospectors, whether they struck it rich or not, caused a boom in the economy focused on serving the needs of these prospectors. This further supported and reinforced the drive west with railroads and settlements. Sutter himself was a farmer who discovered a gold nugget in a river running through his land. He was ultimately ruined when his farmhands ran off to join the search for gold and his livestock were poached by squatters.</string>
    <string _locid="100384">The mountain called Cerro Rico housed a fabulously rich silver mine. The mining town of Potosi, in what is now Bolivia, mushroomed to service these mines. Spanish viceroys - charged with overseeing Spain's interests - exploited the Incan concept of public service, mita, to work the mines. Much of the silver siphoned back to Spain from the New World was from the mines of Potosi.</string>
    <string _locid="100385">Scientific Name: Alces alces\nApprox. Size: 7 ft. at the shoulder, 1,500 lb.\nDiet: Leaves, buds, bark, roots, and lichen\n \nThe largest member of the deer family, moose are found in the northern reaches of North America, forming small herds for the summer and larger herds for the winter. They have long, thin legs and shoulders that are humped and support a short, thick neck and a large, elongated head. The males have an unusual set of flattened antlers that they use aggressively during mating season. Moose are strong swimmers, swimming lakes and even diving to reach underwater roots.</string>
    <string _locid="100386">Scientific Name: Ovibos moschatus\nApprox. Size: 4 ft. at the shoulder, 900 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, lichen\n \nMusk ox have shaggy coats with long guardhairs that protect them from the bitter conditions of their tundra home. These guardhairs can grow up to three feet in length and are light brown in the summer and almost black in the winter. Musk oxen have broad, sharp hooves that distribute their weight on the snow and allow them to dig under the ice for grass to eat. Males have a pair of distinctively broad-based horns that form a hard plate over the brow, swooping down and then abruptly up into hooks.\n \nThey travel in large groups and, when threatened, form a circle with the adults facing outward and the young safely inside the ring. Wolves and humans are the chief predators of the musk ox.</string>
    <string _locid="100388">Scientific Name: Ursus maritimus\nApprox. Size: Up to 600 lb. (female); up to 1,700 lb. (male)\nDiet: Seals, whales, caribou\n \nPolar bears live further north than any other land mammal and are the largest living land carnivores. They use a variety of hunting techniques. White fur and padded paws allow them to stalk seals resting on the ice. They have been known to wait next to seal breathing holes for hours in order to pull a 250-pound seal up onto the ice. They are also strong enough to create new breathing holes to bait seals.\n \nDespite their hunting strategies, polar bears make successful kills less than 15% of the time. Fortunately, they can eat a lot of meat, over 150 pounds, at one time, and can go without food for weeks. Scores of polar bears have been seen feeding on the carcasses of dead whales.</string>
    <string _locid="100389">Scientific Name: Antilocapra americana\nApprox. Size: 3 ft. at the shoulder, 100 lb.\nDiet: Shrubs, grasses, sagebrush\n \nThe pronghorn is sometimes called an antelope, but is not an actual antelope, though closely related. Pronghorns are small and lean and are fast runners - the fastest North American mammal, with top speeds of 60 mph. They have light brown coats, white bellies, white throat stripes, and a white patch on their rumps that they use to signal danger to the others in their small herds. The horns that give them their name have a bony core surrounded by a hairlike sheath that is shed annually.\n \nTheir chief predators are wolves, coyotes, and humans. Their calves are sometimes carried off by golden eagles.</string>
    <string _locid="100390">Scientific Name: Rhea americana; Pterocnemia pennata\nApprox. Size: 5 ft. at the shoulder, 50 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, herbs, roots, insects\n \nRheas are tall, flightless birds that live in South America. They resemble ostriches, but lack the ostriches' full tail plumage. Rheas have grayish brown feathers and white underbellies. When mating, male rheas assemble a flock of females and then construct and incubate a nest that can contain dozens of eggs. After the eggs are hatched the male cares for the hatchlings until they are able to defend themselves. As adults, rheas have few predators other than man.</string>
    <string _locid="100391">Scientific Name: Ovis aries\nApprox. Size: 2 ft, at the shoulder, 100 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, sedges, lichen, mosses\n \nDomesticated sheep have been kept by humans for thousands of years as sources of milk, wool, and meat. They are social creatures and gather in flocks, or mobs, known for blindly following the movement of their groups. In fact, there are distinct roles in the leadership of a mob. "Outliers" act as scouts and risk predation by ranging away from the herd in search of water and grazing. "Bellweathers" are sheep that watch the outliers and follow when it appears the outlier is safe. The rest of the flock then follows the bellweather. Sheep eat plants that other livestock will not and are now used in rotation with other livestock to maximize the grazing of pasture land and also as a form of natural weed control.</string>
    <string _locid="100392">Scientific Name: Tapirus bairdii; Tapirus pinchaque; Tapirus terrestris\nApprox. Size: 3 ft. at the shoulder, 350 lb.\nDiet: Leaves, berries, fruit\n \nThree species of tapir live in Central and South America. They resemble pigs, but are really relatives of horses and rhinoceroses. They have short legs, thick bodies, and a tapered, prehensile snout. They are largely nocturnal, though one species that lives in the Andes is diurnal. Fossilized remains of tapirs have been dated at 50 million years old!\n \nThey are preyed upon by big cats, bears, anacondas, crocodiles, and humans.</string>
    <string _locid="100393">An astonishing variety of trees and plants thrive in the rain forests of the Amazon basin. Kapok, Brazil Nut, Chicle, and Capirona are just a few of these remarkable trees. Some have developed buttress roots that resemble narrow walls and butt against the trunks of tall rain forest trees, helping to keep them upright. Some of these roots can snake out a hundred feet from the tree they help feed and support.\n \nTens of thousands of individual plant species make up the diverse plant life of the Amazon rain forest. Plants cluster in dense thickets up and down the great trunks of the trees, including vines, epiphytes, and funghi. Ferns, orchids, and lilies grow in the damp shade of the rain forest canopy.</string>
    <string _locid="100394">The wetlands of the bayou are host to many species of plants and trees, including fragrant, glossy-leaved magnolia trees and spreading oaks shrouded with gray-green Spanish moss. In the deep backwaters of the bayou, grasses and sedges grow thick in the underbrush. In some areas, winter flooding carries away a lot of leaf litter, making the ground relatively uncluttered, except for new growth and grasses.</string>
    <string _locid="100395">The Caribbean islands support a wide variety of plants and trees in a variety of ecosystems. Coastal areas have palms and low brush, while mountainous interior regions have rain and cloud forests. The machineel tree is the most dangerous and poisonous tree in the region. It grows in coastal areas, and its milky sap can cause burns and blistering. When used for firewood, the smoke can burn the skin and eyes. It has a sweet plum-sized fruit that causes blistering in the mouth and throat. Even sheltering under a machineel tree during a rainstorm can result in painful rashes and blistering.</string>
    <string _locid="100396">Long and shortleaf pine, redbud, several species of birch, maple, and oak, and many other trees form the woodlands of the Carolinas. Coastal areas of South Carolina are noted for banana trees and palmettos, the latter gives South Carolina it's nickname, "The Palmetto State."</string>
    <string _locid="100397">White eastern pine, white oak, sugar maple, and red pine are some of the trees that live in the land surrounding the Great Lakes. The British used white pines as masts on tall ships. The French were the first Europeans to make use of the tall, straight trees for forts and fortifications in their early explorations into the wilderness around the Great Lakes.</string>
    <string _locid="100398">The Great Plains, while largely covered by vast expanses of hundreds of species of tall and short grasses, has a wide variety of trees that thrive on the windswept plains. Cottonwoods grow tall near waterways, and deer browse brightly fruited coralberry bushes. Red cedar dots the wide, golden grasslands with scrubby, hunkered splashes of deep green. Before the invention of barbed wire, pastureland was hedged by Osage orange trees, also known as "bois d'arc," which were planted in long dense rows and trimmed into stout natural fences.</string>
    <string _locid="100399">New England is famous for the bright red, orange, and yellow leaves of its trees during the fall. A wide variety of trees contribute to the colorful display; birches, basswoods and aspens put on bright yellow colors; and red oaks, sugar maples, and tupelos put on red foliage. Trees are not the only plants to contribute to fall color in New England; sumac, blueberry bushes, and even poison ivy all put on scarlet colors as the hours of sunlight grow shorter.</string>
    <string _locid="100420">The rocky plains of the Pampas are grassy and broad with a variety of plants and trees that grow along the waterways or have otherwise adapted to survive the dry, hot climate. The only tree native to the Pampas is the ombu. It has a massive trunk with softwood that holds moisture well. Poisonous sap keeps grazing animals from browsing its saplings, which grow into 40-foot-tall spreading canopies of dark green leaves that provide much-needed shade to the grassy landscape. Pampas Grass is a striking 10-foot-tall tuft of bushy grass tussocks with feathery, cream-colored plumes.</string>
    <string _locid="100421">Plant species in Patagonia, the southernmost tip of South America, vary from grasses and small, hardy shrubs on the plains to evergreen pines and hardwoods on the mountainous slopes of the Andes. The southern birch is commonly found growing, stunted and bent, on the windy plains.</string>
    <string _locid="100422">Trees vary widely across the entire range of the Rocky Mountains and include juniper, oak, willow, fir, spruce, and pine. Ponderosa pine, with its peculiar "puzzle bark," grows on southern slopes at relatively low elevations. Trees like the Engelmann spruce grow at about 9,000 feet and the gnarled limber pine grows up to the treeline, sometimes hunkering in the windshadow of rocks. Above the tree line there are arctic temperatures and very strong winds. The low, scrubby tundra plants that survive there are specially adapated to trap as much heat as possible and shield themselves from wind and ultraviolet radiation.</string>
    <string _locid="100423">The forests of Saguenay are a tiny part of the boreal forests, or taiga, which ring the globe just south of the tundra. The evergreen forests that stretch throughout Canada, Alaska, Russia, and Scandinavia are, combined, one of the largest land-based ecosystems on the planet. </string>
    <string _locid="100424">Broad expanses of cactus desert stretch throughout the Sonoran deserts. Grassy coastal plains support cattle and heavily irrigated grain and cotton farming. The mountains have many species of cactus (and in fact, more varieties of vegetation than any other desert on earth), which thrive in the Sonoran desert. The most famous of these is the massive saguaro cactus.</string>
    <string _locid="100425">Texas is the second-largest state,  after Alaska. There are many regions and climates, ranging from pine forests and bayous to grassy plains and deserts. Common trees are juniper, mesquite, pecan, and oak. Central and northern Texas is the southern edge of the Great Plains and has wide, grassy prairies. There are stands of pine in the east and scrubby juniper and mesquite in the drier west.</string>
    <string _locid="100426">The Yucatan has a variety of climate zones, tending to be drier in the north and more humid in the south. Bananas, bright bougainvillea, and coconut palms are common plants in the region. Fish poison tree, wild tamarind, and bay cedar are just a few of the trees that thrive on the Yucatan peninsula.</string>
    <string _locid="100427">The Yukon has long winters and short summers, when hardy grains and flowering plants thrive briefly. The sparsely limbed sub-alpine fir is well adapted to the heavy snows of Yukon winter. Forests of black spruce and white spruce grow throughout the region, cropping up amidst sedgewort-covered plains.</string>
    <string _locid="100428">Scientific Name: Meleagris gallopavo\nApprox. Size: 30 in. tall, 20 lb.\nDiet: Seeds, roots, berries, nuts, insects, small vertebrates\n \nWild turkeys range throughout North America, chiefly in the east. They have dark bodies with light-tipped feathers, banded wing feathers, and a bluish head. Males have a bright red wattle under their beaks and a dramatic fanning tail. They are competent fliers, but are more likely to flee danger on foot at speeds of up to 25 mph. Solitary during mating season, females build nests on the ground, at the foot of trees, or in the shelter of a bush or tall grass where she lays about a dozen eggs. Turkeys are known for the "gobbling" sounds made by males. They are the centerpiece of modern Thanksgiving meals, though the Pilgrims had a variety of game at their first Thanksgiving feast.\n \nBenjamin Franklin disapproved of the Bald Eagle as the national bird, considering it craven and cowardly. The turkey was a much more noble and worthy bird in his opinion. Coyotes and foxes are the chief predators of adult turkeys. Turkeys and their eggs and young fall victim to a wide variety of small predators.</string>
    <string _locid="100429">Scientific Name: Canis lupus\nApprox. Size: 50-150 lb.\nDiet: Deer, caribou, elk, sheep, small mammals\n \nHistorically, gray wolves could be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic to the tropics. Habitat destruction and hunting have greatly reduced their ranges. They are highly social animals that live and hunt in packs of up to thirty-six individuals, led by an alpha male and female. Unrelated immigrants may be adopted into a pack. Packs are generally territorial and patrol their domains against intruders. Except for the red wolf, all living wolves are considered to be part of the C. lupus species. Domestic dogs, including feral subspecies such as dingos, are also classified as wolves. Domestication, perhaps as many as five different times, has lead to significant (but genetically irrelevant) differences between wolves and dogs.</string>

    <string _locid="100435">The daughter of an English nobleman, Elisabet Ramsey fled her home at an early age rather than face an arranged marriage. The new colonies in the Caribbean offered her the freedom she sought, and more. Elisabet made a name for herself in the privateer fleets of the British and Dutch, and soon commanded her own pirate fleet, led by her flagship, Paris Burning. Flirtatious and cheerful, her lust for the finer things in life is often her undoing.</string>

    <string _locid="100441">The frontiersman John Black is Morgan's grandson and the son of Phillip Black. A loner, he prefers the company of his Haudenosaunee friends to that of European colonists, and the quiet of the backwoods New England countryside to the bustle of Boston and Philadelphia. John keeps a cool head even under the worst of circumstances, but pursues harsh vengeance when wronged.</string>
    <string _locid="100442">K√°:nien attacks with a bow and knife. He has a lot of hitpoints and a special ranged attack, Red Buffalo Arrow, that he can use once every couple of minutes.

    <string _locid="100445">Nonahkee is the sister of K√°:nien. Soft-spoken and gentle, she has always been a calming influence on both her brother and his friend John Black. Underestimated by her adversaries, her quiet demeanor masks a determined inner strength. With her knowledge of the medicinal properties of herbs, Nonahkee has mended John Black's wounds on more than one occasion.</string>
    <string _locid="100446">Stuart attacks with his hands when he has to fight at all. He has a lot of hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Stuart can collect Treasures, but is usually too scared to venture beyond his colony to find them. Stuart cannot build Trading Posts.</string>
    <string _locid="100447">Fourth (and neglected) son of Morgan Black, Stuart has devoted his life to making money, eating well, and staying out of danger. An expert at navigating the murky political waters in England, he was recently sent to govern a new colony in the Americas, but found that he was unprepared for the harsh realities of the frontier. He has had to rely on John's band of mercenaries for protection.</string>
    <string _locid="100448">Warwick prefers to fight with a sword, but is also known as a deadly shot with a rifle.

He served in the First Virginia Regiment (part of the British military) as a lieutenant colonel. While trying to drive the French out of Ohio Country, Washington set off a series of events that eventually ignited the Seven Years' War, also known as the French and Indian War. In 1759 he left the military, married, and settled back in Virginia with his wife and family. In later years Washington would go on to have a significant role in the founding of the United States of America.</string>

    <string _locid="100453">A determined, fiery young woman in her late twenties, Amelia is the daughter of Nathaniel Black, the granddaughter of John Black, and president of the Falcon Company. A competitive industrialist, she hopes to make Falcon the first railroad company to lay track all the way to the west coast. All too familiar with the dangers of the frontier, Amelia is a crack shot, and her gun is never far from her hand.</string>

    <string _locid="100455">The trapper Pierre Beaumont's past is shrouded in mystery. His accent is French, but hard to place; is he from Quebec, Paris, or New Orleans? In any event, it has been many years since he was near a city - or a bathtub. Clever and bloodthirsty, Beaumont is deadly in a fight, wielding his twin knives with skill and precision.</string>
    <string _locid="100456">Bolivar attacks with a rifle and sword. He has a lot of hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Bolivar can collect Treasures, but cannot build Trading Posts.</string>
    <string _locid="100457">Simon Bolivar was born in Caracas, a Spanish town on the Caribbean in present-day Venezuela. He led soldiers and settlers in their revolt against Spain. He was called "the Liberator," and was responsible for leading the present-day nations of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela to freedom from Spain. In 1821 he was named president of Gran Colombia, but the fractious nations splintered apart, despite Bolivar's rash efforts to keep them together by declaring himself dictator in 1828. After a failed assassination attempt, and no real improvement in the stability of his rule, Bolivar resigned his presidency and died of tuberculosis in 1830.</string>
    <string _locid="100458">Cooper attacks with a pair of cavalry pistols and prefers to fight from horseback. He has the ability to train Hussars as if he were a moving Stable.

    <string _locid="100459">A cavalry commander in the U.S. Army, Cooper is a veteran of the frontier and a career military officer. He has tangled with everyone from the Lakota to the Mexican army and has always come out on top. Cooper is everything an officer should be: brave, smart, and certain where his loyalties lie. His only flaw is a touch of overconfidence; he never admits he's made a mistake.</string>
    <string _locid="100460">A level of technological, military, and economic advancement. Ages are purchased like improvements and make new units, buildings, improvements, and Home City Shipments available. Five Ages are available: the Exploration Age, the Commerce Age, the Fortress Age, the Industrial Age, and the Imperial Age. Games default to the Exploration Age, which starts your colony off with the bare minimum. The Nomad Age occurs before the Exploration Age, but is more of a game type, rather than a true Age. See Nomad Age.</string>
    <string _locid="100461">Artificial intelligence (AI). When you play a game with computer allies or enemies those computer players are controlled by an AI.</string>
    <string _locid="100463">A land-based military unit with long range and high building attack. Artillery are expensive, slow, ranged units. They are vulnerable to attacks between volleys, and especially vulnerable to units that can get close to them quickly, like cavalry. Artillery rely on their big attack and long range to do their damage. Most artillery units are very good at destroying buildings. Artillery units take more population slots than any other unit.</string>
    <string _locid="100464">A black area of a map representing places that neither you nor your allies have explored. As soon as you send units to explore these black areas, the black map is replaced by the fog of war. See also line of sight and fog of war.</string>

    <string _locid="100467">A land-based military unit with high speed. Cavalry are mounted soldiers that use their speed to close quickly with other units and flee battles they do not want to fight.</string>
    <string _locid="100462">Computer players chosen as enemies and allies in Skirmish or Multiplayer game types. Each of the eight civilizations is represented by a famous historical ruler or dignitary. These AI personalities, in the guise of a historical persona, will request or offer aid, taunt, encourage, and remember previous games you played with or against them.</string>
    <string _locid="100479">As a Home City rises in level you earn points that you can spend to customize how your city looks in terms of its buildings and inhabitants. This ranges from changing most or all of your buildings to different materials and color to populating your streets with hordes of fire-eaters and butchers.</string>
    <string _locid="100468">Deathmatch is very fast-paced starting players with alot of resources, skipping the gathering process and allowing players to begin building their civilizations immediatley.</string>
    <string _locid="100469">A Deck is a collection of Cards. "Card" is another name for the Shipments that you can send from your Home City. In Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, leveling your Home City to unlock cards will no longer be required. All Cards will be available.</string>
    <string _locid="100470">Ensemble Studios Online. An internet-based matchmaking service that supports thousands of simultaneous Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition players. ESO is a place to meet players, find games, and check stats. You can find ESO by navigating to the Multiplayer section on the Main menu.</string>
    <string _locid="100471">An award during play for maintaining a presence in the New World: for constructing buildings, training units, destroying buildings, and killing units. Experience accumulates over time and allows you to raise the level of your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="100472">A land-based unit that can collect Treasures and often has special attacks. Explorers (and Heroes in the Story Mode) are some of the few units that can collect Treasures in the New World. The Explorer can also build Trading Posts, and since he's much tougher than any gatherer, he is often a good choice for either task.</string>
    <string _locid="100473">Explorers (and Heroes in the Story Mode) cannot be killed. When they are reduced to one hitpoint, they collapse onto the ground and cannot be commanded. At this point they have to be rescued by capturing the area around them. Make sure there are no enemy units or buildings nearby, then send someone to the Explorer's rescue. When they have regenerated enough hitpoints, they stand up, grateful for your efforts.</string>
    <string _locid="100474">The fog of war falls over areas that have been explored but are not currently in line of sight. See also black map and line of sight.</string>
    <string _locid="100475">A unit that gathers resources from objects in the New World. Settlers, Coureurs des Bois, Settler Wagons, and Cree Coureurs are all resource gatherers. Most colonies will have Settlers, but some civilizations have unique gatherers. Gatherers scour the New World for the resources that help your colony grow. They are the backbone of any colony and are, ideally, always busy. They have a lot to do - they fish, farm, mine, herd, chop, hunt, and build. Idle gatherers can be located by pressing their hotkey or selecting their UI button found near the Resource panel.</string>
    <string _locid="100476">Hand attack refers to the damage a unit does in melee, or non-ranged, combat. Units with big hand attacks do a lot of damage with each attack that they make. Most ranged units also have at least a small hand attack. Some units, like the musketeer, have good ranged and hand attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="100477">An attribute that represents how much damage a unit or building can take.</string>
    <string _locid="100478">A representation of the European or Ottoman civilization that provides Shipments of units, resources, and improvements to New World colonies. This city persists from game to game, and grows in power and flexibility as it gains levels from experience earned in the New World. A player can develop several Home Cities, or focus on just one. Each Home City has several tiers of options that become available as the city advances in level.\n \nDuring a game you interact with the Home City by clicking the Shipment button and then selecting an available Shipment to send from the Home City to the New World. Most Shipments can only be sent once. If you have gained a lot of experience in the New World you can have two or three Shipments ready to send. Over the course of a game you can send a dozen or more Shipments from the Home City to the New World.</string>
    <string _locid="100480">A representation of advances in technology that have economic or military benefits. Improvements are mostly found in New World buildings, though some are available as Shipments to the New World. Economic improvements can make gatherers more resistant to enemy attacks or more productive at collecting resources. Military improvements represent the discipline of more and more experienced soldiers and better and better armaments.</string>
    <string _locid="100481">Any land-based foot soldier, whether ranged or melee. Infantry usually cost only one or two population slots and this allows you to train about twice as many infantry as you can cavalry. However, cavalry are about twice as tough as infantry, so it comes down to how effectively you manage your units in combat and how well your economy supports training new soldiers to replace those killed in battle.</string>
    <string _locid="100482">Line of sight (LOS) is the radius around a unit or building that it can see. Buildings tend to have a large line of sight, while units tend to have a smaller line of sight. See also fog of war and black map.</string>
    <string _locid="100483">A generic term referring to the space where Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is played.</string>
    <string _locid="100484">A maplike representation of the game world. The Mini Map shows a top-down look at the map, where colored dots represent objects like trees, buildings, and units. During play, the Mini Map is located in the lower right side of the screen.</string>
    <string _locid="100485">A game type that pits you against other players either Online or via LAN play.</string>
    <string _locid="100486">Native inhabitants of the New World who will share their warriors and technology after an alliance is established. An alliance is formed with a group of Native Americans by building a Trading Post near their settlement. Native American warriors do not cost population slots.</string>
    <string _locid="100487">Nomad is a game type that starts players out with only their Explorer, a Covered Wagon, and one or two additional units. The Covered Wagon is used to construct a Town Center. Once it is constructed, the player automatically advances to the Exploration Age and receives their initial gatherers and crates. Since you cannot get any gatherers or Home City Shipments until the Town Center is placed, it is important in a Nomad game to either place your Town Center quickly to get a fast start, or to more carefully pick a spot on the map for strategic benefit later in the game.</string>
    <string _locid="100488">Dignitaries from the Home City who guide your colony into the next Age. Each time you advance in Age you must choose one of several politicians. Each politician delivers an assortment of resources or units as he arrives. New politicians can be unlocked in the Home City as its level increases.</string>
    <string _locid="100489">The success of a colony can be measured by the size and health of its population. In Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, population defines how large your colony can grow. Nearly all units that are trained occupy population slots (but Native Americans do not). Most gatherers have a small impact on your available population and take only one slot. Most infantry take one or two slots, cavalry can take two to six slots, and a single cannon can take eight slots!\n \nBuild Houses (Manors for the British) and Town Centers to increase your population limit. </string>
    <string _locid="100490">A representation of the New World that allows each game played to be different from the last. Random Maps simulate different geographical locations in the Americas. Each has a unique set of terrain and features - rivers, oceans, herdable animals, Trade Routes, Native American settlements - that affect gameplay.</string>
    <string _locid="100491">Range is the farthest distance that a unit can fire or throw a weapon. Units with ranged attacks tend to do well against units without ranged attacks (hand-attack or melee units) because they can inflict damage while the melee units march in close enough to attack.</string>
    <string _locid="100492">An attribute that represents how much defense against attacks and damage a unit has. Resistance reflects agility, armor, or the general toughness of a unit.</string>
    <string _locid="100493">A resource collected chiefly by gatherers and used to train units or research improvements. While Food and Wood are critical to the early game, Coin becomes more important in later Ages. As the gold and silver Mines on the map dwindle, it is important to think about alternate sources of Coin. Estates and crates, whether from the Home City or Trading Posts, are a good source of Coin later in a game. On certain maps, Fishing Boats and Caravels can hunt beluga whales for Coin.</string>
    <string _locid="100494">A cache of resources that gatherers can collect very quickly. Crates of Food, Cords of Wood, and Chests of Coin are generally delivered from the Home City to Town Centers or Outposts. They provide resources very quickly, but in a very limited amount. Any player can gather from any crate, which means allies can share them or enemies can steal them if they are left at a Town Center. Guard crates carefully, or better yet, use them as soon as possible!</string>
    <string _locid="100495">A resource collected chiefly by gatherers and used to train units or research improvements. Food is the most important early resource because it determines how quickly and smoothly you can get your economy going by training Settlers and other resource gatherers. Apart from crates, hunted animals provide the fastest source of Food, followed by herding cows and sheep, gathering berries, fishing, and farming. Fishing and farming can be upgraded in later Ages to very efficient sources of Food.</string>
    <string _locid="100496">A resource collected chiefly by gatherers and used to construct buildings, train units or research improvements. Wood is an important resource as your colony shifts from survival to expansion. Wood can come from trees, crates, and Treasures, but regardless of the source, the Wood itself is the same.</string>
    <string _locid="100497">Resources are collected by gatherers from trees, animals, plants, crates, and Mines in the New World. Resources can also be gathered from certain buildings. Players spend resources to train units, construct buildings, research improvements, and advance in Age. Food, Wood, and Coin are the primary resources of Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition. Population and experience are also a type of resource, but not one collected by gatherers. Population is provided by building houses and Town Centers. Experience is earned by constructing buildings, training units, destroying buildings, and killing units.</string>
    <string _locid="100498">A delivery of military units, gatherers, improvements, or crates of resources from your Home City. Shipments represent your successes in the New World and the support your Home City offers your colony.</string>
    <string _locid="100499">Naval unit. Ships are any unit on the water and vary from small, weak Fishing Boats to large, dangerous Frigates. You can build only a limited number of each type of ship. Certain improvements available in your Home City allow you to maintain a greater number of a certain type of ship.</string>
    <string _locid="100465">An attack that does damage to buildings. Units with a high siege attack are good at destroying buildings and walls. Artillery have a high siege attack, as do an assortment of other units like Halberdiers and Russian Oprichniks.</string>
    <string _locid="100520">A single-player game mode. This game type allows you to play with and against the AI personalities on one of several Random Maps.</string>
    <string _locid="100521">An attribute that shows how fast a unit moves on land or sea. Speed allows units to get into a fight quickly, like rushing up to cannon before it gets too many volleys off, or chasing down Settlers. Speed also allows units to flee or retreat quickly, making them hard to catch. Generally speaking, mounted units (cavalry) are faster than any foot units (infantry, gatherers and, though most are drawn by horses, artillery), although there are some speedy foot units and some slow cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="100522">The Trading Post can only be built in certain locations in the New World. Building one by a Native American settlement gives you access to Native American units and improvements. Building one along a Trade Route allows you to improve the Trade Route and supplement your economy with trade goods in the form of resources or experience. Unallied Native settlements appear on the Mini Map as a white arrowhead. Trade Routes appear on the Mini Map as a white line, and unclaimed trade sites appear as white coins.</string>
    <string _locid="100523">Treasures are scattered around the New World. When collected, they can provide resources, units, or experience. When you find one, the area of the map around the Treasure is revealed. Treasures are sometimes guarded by one or more guardians, who must be killed before you can collect the Treasure. Explorers and gatherers can collect Treasures. Treasures appear on the Mini Map as white Xs.</string>
    <string _locid="100524">A generic term referring to objects in the game that can be selected and, usually, attacked or given commands. Units are soldiers, ships, artillery, and gatherers. Unit may also refer to a trader traveling up and down Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="100525">This Crate of Coin provides Coin at a very fast rate, but in a very limited amount. Use a gatherer to collect the Coin. Crates usually come from the Home City, but can come from Trading Posts or can be placed specially as part of the map. Any player can gather from any crate, which means allies can share them or enemies can steal them if they are left at an unattended Trading Post or Town Center. Guard crates carefully or, better yet, use them as soon as possible!\n \nHistory:\n \nSupplies from Europe were often vital to the survival of a struggling colony in the New World. The colony at Roanoake had the misfortune of being established during a time of drought in the area, leading to difficulties growing Food. In addition, the colony's relationship with the Native American people in the area was not good. The colonists had so many difficulties that they left the colony before a desperately needed supply ship could arrive.\n \nWhen the supply ship finally arrived it found the colony abandoned.

    <string _locid="100187">The Coureur des Bois is the main resource gatherer for the French. Coureur des Bois are expensive compared to standard Settlers, but have a good damage and decent range. They are, however, not meant for combat, but will defend themselves better than the gatherers of other nations. Coureurs des Bois can be used to collect Treasures.\n \nThere is a limit to the number of Coureurs des Bois that the French can have at once. They pay for themselves rather quickly and the longer an individual Coureur des Bois is alive, the more it contributes to the overall wealth of a given Colony. Coureurs des Bois can be sent from the Home City, trained in the New World and, if you have an alliance, trained at Cree settlements.\n \nHistory:\n \nCoureur des Bois is French for "runner in the woods," the name given to a group of French fur traders. They came from all walks of French and colonial French life to hunt and trap animals for their pelts in North America. One of the first native-born Canadian explorers was Louis Jolliet, who at a young age determined that he would become a Coureur des Bois. He and a handful of other Coureurs des Bois paddled down the Mississippi river in canoes, determining that it would empty into the Gulf of Mexico, but feared to travel as far as the mouth into the hands of the Spanish. They noted rivers to the west as they went, hoping that one would flow into the seas of China or Japan. He became well-established in the fur trade and had several land holdings that he traveled between. It was on a trip to one of these that he died in 1700.</string>

Size: 130 lb. (female); 380 lb. (male)\nDiet: Fruits, grasses, roots, nuts, herbs, insects, fish, carrion\n \nThe black bear is the most common bear in North America. They live in a variety of habitats, preferring forests with an abundance of undergrowth that provides them with food, shelter, and protection from their rare, but fearsome, predators. Black bears scale trees to escape threats. Humans and other bears, even other black bears, are the chief predator of black bears.\n \nIn colder climates, the black bear enters true hibernation, but in warmer ranges the bears do not reach the depth of hibernating sleep, though they sleep for extended periods of time in the cold months.\n \nThere are sixteen subspecies of black bear. One, the Ursus americanus kermodei, is a white, but not albino, subspecies that lives in the Pacific Northwest and is referred to as a Spirit Bear in some native traditions. Ursus am_ricanus emmonsii, the glacier bear, has gray and white hairs in its coat, giving a striking blue appearance to this bear's coat.</string>

(male)\nDiet: Roots, fungi, fish, insects, large and small mammals\n \nA subspecies of the largest species of bear (the brown bear), grizzlies get their name from the white tips of their fur that give them a rough, weathered appearance. The hump of muscle, visible in profile, between the grizzly's shoulders is massive and gives incredible strength to their forequarters, allowing them to dig and strike. Its claws three to four inches long; there are not many mammals that can withstand the powerful strike of a grizzly bear. They spend the better part of the fall season fattening up for the lean winter months, when they become sluggish if not actually hibernating. Grizzlies find or excavate dens for the winter months, usually just large enough for themselves, with an entry that lets air circulate.\n \nGrizzly bears once ranged throughout North America west of the Mississippi and as far south as Mexico. Today they live in rugged, remote mountain and forest wilderness areas.</string>

Size: Up to 7 ft. long, 200 lb.\nDiet: Deer, cattle, peccary, capybara, monkeys, fish\n \nJaguars are often confused with leopards, another tawny, spotted cat. A distinguising feature of the jaguar is that its spots have small black dots or irregular shapes within rosette patterns. Jaguars are also stockier and have larger heads than leopards. Both jaguars and leopards have melanistic, or black, variants. Without spots, black jaguars can be differentiated from black leopards primarily by their stocky build. Both big cats, whether jaguars or leopards, black or spotted, are commonly, if mistakenly, called panthers.\n \nHistorically, jaguars ranged from the southern parts of North America down to the southern most tip of South America, but their ranges now are in central and northern South America. Jaguars enjoy a rare, unchallenged perch at the top of the wild food chain. In their South American habitat, they have no predators and few real competitors, apart from humans.</string>

(male)\nDiet: Sseals, whales, caribou\n \nPolar bears live further north than any other land mammal and are the largest living land carnivores.Polar bears use a variety of hunting techniques. White fur and padded paws mean they can stalk seals resting on the ice. They have been known to wait next to seal breathing holes for hours in order to pull a 250-pound seal up onto the ice. They are also strong enough to create new breathing holes to bait seals.\n \nDespite their hunting strategies, polar bears make successful kills less than 15% of the time. Fortunately, they can eat a lot of meat, over 150 pounds at one sitting, and can go without food for weeks. Scores of polar bears have been seen feeding on the carcasses of dead whales.</string>

Size: 50-150 lb.\nDiet: Deer, caribou, elk, sheep, small mammals\n \nHistorically, gray wolves could be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic to the tropics. Habitat destruction and hunting have greatly reduced their range. They are highly social animals that live and hunt in packs of up to thirty-six individuals led by an alpha male and female. Unrelated immigrants may be adopted into a pack. Packs are generally territorial and patrol their domains against intruders. Except for the red wolf, all living wolves are considered to be part of the C. lupus species. Domestic dogs, including feral subspecies such as dingos, are also classified as wolves. Domestication, perhaps as many as five different times, has lead to significant (but genetically irrelevant) differences between wolves and dogs.</string>

Ponderosa pine with its peculiar "puzzle bark" grows on southern slopes at relatively low elevations. Trees like the Engelmann spruce grow at about 9,000 feet, and the gnarled limber pine grows up to the treeline, sometimes hunkering in the windshadow of rocks. Above the tree line there are arctic temperatures and very strong winds. The low, scrubby tundra plants that survive here are specially adapated to trap as much heat as possible and shield themselves from wind and ultraviolet radiation.</string>

    <string _locid="100634">The train travels along a predetermined Trade Route and delivers Experience, Food, Wood, or Coin to any Trading Post it passes. The Trade Route starts as a dirt track and can be improved over the course of a game. The Trade Route appears as a white line on the Mini Map. Any player can build on an unclaimed Trading Post site. Enemy players can own Trading Posts along the same Trade Route.\n \nBuilding a Trading Post along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or increase the speed at which shipments come from the Home City. The locomotive is the last upgrade available for the Trade Route. It delivers goods more quickly than the Stagecoach and Travois.\n \nHistory:\n \nEarly freight cars were largely made of wood, and had cast iron wheels and hand brakes. They carried all manner of goods north and south, east and west across North America. Flatcars were used to carry bulky or larger objects and boxcars were used to transport smaller goods.</string>
    <string _locid="100635">Walls are a defensive building placed in a ring or arc to enclose and protect units, or placed across a narrow gap to restrict enemy movement through an area. They are relatively cheap to build and effective at keeping out early attacks, but when artillery show up, walls become significantly less of an obstacle. The lesson: if you want walls, try to build them early; if you see your enemy has extensive walls, artillery are a good means to destroy them (and a lot more).\n \nHistory:\n \nEarly fortifications in the New World were palisades constructed of the trunks of trees, which were sharpened and driven into the ground side by side to form walls. Some of these palisade walls, especially when a little green, were remarkably effective at withstanding bombardment by artillery because they could flex as they were hit, rather than splintering like properly dried wood or shattering like masonry walls.\n \nMore effective than either wood or stone at withstanding bombardment were the bermed earthworks famously ringing star forts like Fort McHenry. A fort in the era of cannon was a series of sculpted plains, ditches, bastions, and walls of earth and stone that maximized line of sight and fire for defenders.</string>
    <string _locid="100544">This Aztec jaguar warrior leads the Aztec here while the Aztec army is away.\n \nHistory:\n \nAbout Aztec leaders:\n \nIn the middle of the thirteenth century, the Aztec settled near lake Texcoco. A priest and ruler, Tenoch, oversaw the founding of the city Tenochtitlan and was the first Huei Tlatoani, or emperor. Eleven known rulers followed Tenoch, including Moctezuma II, the ruler who presided over the Aztec as the Spanish conquistadors under Cortes made landfall in 1519. Moctezuma II lived only another year. Two Tlatoani followed him: Cuitlahuac and the last Tlatoani of the Aztec, Cuauhtemoc, who was killed by the Spanish in 1824.</string>
    <string _locid="100545">The Spanish have forced these Aztec to mine gold and silver for them. If their captors are killed, they will join you.\n \nHistory:\n \nEuropean governors and Conquistadors were given, amongst their other directives, the task of Christianizing the Native Americans they encountered. If the natives resisted they were to be enslaved or killed. Some, like Diego de Alcaraz, approached their goals with cruel brutality. Others, like Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, were known for empathy and a degree of tolerance in their drive to bring Christianity to the Native Americans of South and Central America.</string>

When the Spanish are driven off, the Aztec will share their knowledge of the Lake of the Moon, which they learned from the Carib.\n \nHistory:\n \nThe Aztec built large and heavily ornamented stepped pyramids. These were the center of their worship and where they performed the sacrifices that they believed pleased the gods, caused the sun to rise, and made their empire strong. However, the Aztec did not build all of their sacred sites; a little-understood people built the massive temple complex at Teotihuacan, including a Temple of the Moon and a Temple of the Sun. These unknown people, possibly the Toltecs, abandoned their great city after an attack razed the city some time before 1000 CE.</string>

Units with range can damage the Boneguard before they are able to close, and mounted units can flee from them.\n \nHistory:\n \nThe Boneguard are modeled loosely after the Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, better known as the Knights Templar. The Knights Templar was a very influential order formed in the twelfth century to protect Christian pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land. Some saw the Knights Templar as corrupt because over time they became involved deeply in finance and politics. They became much more secularly oriented than other knightly orders, and rulers coveted their power.

The centuries following the Spanish plunder of the Aztec, Inca, and Maya was the golden age of piracy. Spanish galleons, wallowing low in the water with all the gold they had taken on, were returning from the Carribean to Spain, where the money would fund wars against the French, Ottomans, and Dutch. The treasure galleons were slow, fat targets, very well defended, and wholly irresistible to pirates. In 1628, five years after he had arrived in the West Indies, Piet Hien, Dutch trader for the West India Company, could not resist taking on the treasure fleet. He managed to corner part of the fleet in the Bay of Matanzas and captured millions upon millions of guilders in gold, silver, and trade goods.\n \nSome pirate bands were highly democratic, electing their captains and making important decisions by vote.

Something or someone else must have rallied them against the colony.\n \nHistory:\n \nCherokee archers used distinct bows with diamond-shaped grooves (called "nocks") at each end to hold the bowstring. The bows were often made from Bois d‚Äôarc, and had bowstring of deer sinew. To test their skills, archers competed against each other in games known as cornstalk shoots. Dried cornstalks were used as targets because they wouldn‚Äôt break arrow tips. </string>

The archer and the horse move as one, and it is vital that the archer have a trusted companion in his horse. The Cherokee originally obtained horses from Spanish colonists. They bred them and added in bloodlines from plains horses when they moved west. Cherokee horses, very prized, can often be recognized by their unique paint patterns.</string>

These houses often had roofs that were covered with flowers or grasses. Later, traditional houses were replaced by homes more like the Europeans' log cabins. In Cherokee villages the houses were clustered around a central council house that was used for ceremonies, including those performed before going to war, and for political purposes.</string>

The Incan leader can collect Treasures, but cannot build Trading Posts.\n \nHistory:\n \nThere is record of thirteen Incan emperors. Incan emperors ruled without question by the divine right claimed by kings and pharaohs the world over. A person's home, and their belongings inside it, were the extent of personal property; land, buildings, and virtually everything else belonged to the government. Adults were required by a custom called mita to serve on large public works like buildings or roads (which the Spanish exploited to send the Inca into forced labor in their mines). The Incan Empire lasted about 100 years, starting with Emperor Pachacuti who, through a series of military conquests, began a campaign that by the time the Spaniards arrived had united the native people from northern Colombia to northern Chile under Incan rule.</string>

Her family will be very glad to see her again.\n \nHistory:\n \nOne of the worst insults in the Lakota language translates as "You live as if you had no relatives." This insult shows the importance of family to the Lakota people. Often grandparents, parents, and children lived together in one household, and children were expected to listen to and learn from their elders. Individuals were expected to consider the effect of his or her actions on all members of the extended family.</string>

    <string _locid="100555">This dinghy can be used to transport units over the water.\n \nHistory:\n \nDinghies and other small boats are part of the equipment maintained by seafaring ships for a variety of purposes. They are stored on deck, along the sides, or even towed behind if too big to store on the ship. In the era of tall ships, boats were used as landing vessels, to transport crew between ships in a fleet, to fetch supplies from shore, and to maintain a ship at sea.</string>
    <string _locid="100556">This drydock is repairing ships.\n \nHistory:\n \nThe first drydock in the Americas was located in Charlestown, Massachusetts. A drydock allows water to be pumped away from a ship so that work can be performed on its hull more easily. Prior to the development of drydocks, a ship had to be turned on its side to allow for work on its bottom. This involved a great deal of labor to take down the ship's masts, remove its guns, and remove all other loose items. This process of "heaving down" a ship could take up to three weeks, and even more time was required to refit the ship once it was turned upright.  </string>

Its plan was drawn up by William Clark, and it took a month to construct the two slope-roofed buildings. The Corps spent a cold winter there in 1805, trading goods and information with the Clatsop tribe, after whom the fort was named. In 1806 the expedition began the trek east to St. Louis.</string>
    <string _locid="100557">This burning ship explodes and does a lot of damage when it rams its target. It has few hitpoints and is vulnerable to ranged attacks as it approaches. Be wary if you see one; try to flee or sink it before it hits. If you are commanding a fireship, try to get it to its target as quickly and directly as possible.\n \nHistory:\n \nVirtually everything on a tall ship is flammable, from wooden planks and tar that seals seams to greased ropes and canvas sails, to gunpowder - especially gunpowder! Black powder ships, also called fireships, were ships set afire and allowed to drift (or were sometimes piloted by a minimal crew, who escaped before impact) into enemy fleets with the purpose of setting them afire and blowing them up. Fireships were particularly nasty when sailed into harbors to destroy immobile ships at anchor.\n \nFireships were used by the English Royal Navy against the larger and more powerful Spanish Armada. Unable to find a proper port or deep mooring, the Spanish fleet congregated in a defensive arc, into which the British sailed a half-dozen fireships, scattering and confusing the Spanish fleet. This allowed the smaller English fleet to engage the Spanish Armada on a more even footing.</string>

The American government purchased the fort in 1849 and used it to protect the settlers who traveled west into Utah, Wyoming, and Oregon. The United States military fought off attacks by the Lakota, who were trying to stem the encroaching tide of settlers and soldiers into the Powder River Country. Led by Red Cloud, an Oglala Lakota chief, the Native Americans inflicted such casualties that eventually the government signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie that preserved Lakota lands and created a temporary peace.</string>

The fort also did an appallingly brisk trade in buffalo hides at the height of the decimation of the buffalo population. The fort was a long, low structure, with wooden palisade walls. The formation of the North West Mounted Police - precursors to the Mounties - caused Fort Whoop-Up and other whiskey posts to be shut down or abandoned. In 1875 the North West Mounted Police turned Fort Whoop-Up into a base of their own.</string>

It is very powerful against other ships, but vulnerable to buildings and land-based artillery. The Frigate is available in a limited number after reaching the Industrial Age.\n \nFrigates have a special Broadside attack that fires all of their cannon in a deadly barrage. This attack must recharge before being used again. Frigates can be constructed in the New World or sent from the Home City.\n \nHistory:\n \nFrigates changed a lot over time, but started out as lean, fast, well-armed ships used for scouting, raiding trade routes, and filling in the line of battle when the larger battleships were scarce. Early frigates carried messages and important passengers. Later, their single deck of twenty to thirty cannon was doubled, to two decks of forty to sixty cannon. British frigate captains, still using the swift, lighter frigates, were ordered not to engage the heavier, deadly American frigates unless the odds were 2:1 in the British captain's favor.\n \nApproximate weight: 950 tons; length: 150 feet.</string>

They are a little faster than proper artillery, but still slower than regular infantry.\n \nHistory:\n \nDuring the Siege of Malta in 1565, the defenders of Malta (the Knights of St. John) relied heavily on incendiary weapons, including ones called the "firework hoop." These weapons, made of gunpowder and wood, were used against advancing Janissaries as they attempted to storm Fort St. Elmo. The incendiary weapons were highly effective, forcing the Janissaries to fall back from their attack. Approximately 2,000 elite Janissaries were killed during the assault on Fort St. Elmo, while only about eighty of their enemy died. After the siege the Knights of St. John, also known as the Knights Hospitaller, controlled Malta until 1798.</string>

These ceremonies involved dance, chant, drinking corn beer, and eating bread made with the blood of a ritually sacrificed llama.\n \nIncan architecture is characterized by massive stones perfectly fitted and held in place by gravity without mortar of any kind. They did build buildings of less significance with irregular, unhewn stones seated in mud, but the cyclopean masonry of of their striking walls are iconically Incan. They favored severe lines in their decorations, and angular carvings.</string>

In North America, the Haudenosaunee are most famous for their longhouses. They were built of fire-hardened posts bent over and tied to posts across from them to make a rounded roof. A door in each end let people in and out, and hides over the doors kept out the cold in the winter. Tall bunk-like platforms allowed much of the space inside to be used. An average longhouse was 50 to 60 feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide. Up to twenty families would live in a single longhouse.</string>

Since Lizzie is probably aboard and the ship itself is pretty tough, it might be best to just avoid this ship and sail elsewhere.\n \nHistory:\n \nLizzie took her ship from a small convoy carrying soldiers to a French colony in the Lesser Antilles. She surprised the ships as they lay at anchor, sheltering from a storm. Sights set on the sleek flagship, Elizabet sent one volley at the helpless ships, missing purposefully. She allowed the soldiers to board the lesser ship of the fleet and made off with her new prize, which she christened Paris Burning.\n \nPirates typically obtained their ships through less than legal means. Once acquired, a ship would be customized to make it faster, more powerful in battle, more nimble, and more efficient in its usage of space. Adequate space was important on a pirate ship, as it was often necessary to carry a large crew to help with fighting or to pilot any additional ships acquired in the course of the pirate's adventuring.\n \nPirates didn't usually have the benefit of servicing their ships in drydock. Instead, they would beach their ship and careen it on its side to service the hull.</string>

The influx of silver into Europe had profound effects on European economies, causing periods of inflation. Silver taken from Central and South America was coined into "Pieces of Eight," and was transported around the world in Spanish ships. These ships were hard for pirates to resist, so the association between Pieces of Eight and pirating has become part of common pirate lore.\n \nIn North America the gold rush of the 1850s fell off and prospectors found the next best thing to gold: silver.

The Knights of St. John, from their island stronghold of Malta, prowled the seas in long, sleek galleys searching out any who would oppose them, with a special preference for the Ottomans. They had a massive flagship, called the Sant'Anna, but it was so ungainly and expensive to maintain that it was broken up. The masts of Morgan's ship were salvaged from the Sant'Anna; the Saint Elmo has more than a little of her predecessor's wallowing unwieldiness.</string>

They were accomplished sailors, crossing the Caribbean in canoes and rafts. They are known to have displaced other island tribes and taken wives from native and European settlments alike. One child, Carib Thomas Warner, was the child of a well-to-do British colonist and a Carib woman. He was raised and educated in his father's house, but abandoned at the age of 15 when his father died. He returned to his mother's people and became a Kalinago chieftain. His mastery of English, French, and Carib helped him pit the French against the English to protect the Carib people. Thomas Warner became a Lieutenant Governer of Dominica and eventually Governor. He oversaw a peace between certain Kalinago tribes and the British. Warner was murdered by Philip Warner, his English half-brother, who also massacred Thomas' entire tribe.</string>

Initially, a shortage of workers made construction of the railroad difficult. Soon veterans of the Civil War swelled the ranks of the workers and allowed the Union Pacific Corporation to complete its railroad across over 1,700 miles of wilderness in less than four years.

    <string _locid="100590">Capture this wagon of resources and return it to your Town Center. It will supply you with Food, Wood, and Coin.\n \nHistory:\n \nSettlers on the frontier traveled west with wagons loaded with supplies. The wagons were packed with everything the settlers would need at their destinations. They were so packed that there wasn't any room to sit in them, which was just fine for most settlers, who did not care for the tooth-rattling ride. Typically only women, children, and the sick ever rode in the backs of their wagons.</string>
    <string _locid="100591">Capture this wagon of resources and return it to your Town Center. It will supply you with Crates of Coin.\n \nHistory:\n \nIn 1848, rumors of a golden nugget found in a river at Sutter's Mill drew prospectors out into the wild frontiers of America in droves. Few grew rich off of their claims, and many gave up, but the growth of the towns that sprung up around bustling mines accelerated the settlement of the west by decades.</string>
    <string _locid="100592">Capture this wagon of resources and return it to your Town Center. It will supply you with Crates of Food.\n \nHistory:\n \nSettlers relied on what food they could grow, barter, and hunt or trap themselves. They planted gardens from seeds they brought with them, or bought from a supply store, or had sent from back East. Much of a frontier settler's time was spent figuring out where the next meal would come from; shipments from back East were welcome - and vitally neccessary.</string>

Black powder is not a proper high explosive, but it is very easy to ignite and must be stored very carefully.</string>

Size: 5 ft. at the shoulder, 2,000 lb.\nDiet: Prairie grasses\n \nBison are a massive, shaggy cattle that once inhabited the central plains of North America in the hundreds of millions. The Native Americans of the plains relied heavily on the migrating herds; they, grizzly bears, and, later, European settlers were the only predators capable of taking a bison down. Bison have huge heads with short, curved horns and large, heavily furred hump at their shoulders.\n \nInfrequently a calf is born with white fur, but otherwise normally pigmented. These white calves are significant in Native American traditions and are greeted with ceremony and prayer.</string>
    <string _locid="100597">This jaguar is behaving in a peculiar manner, unlike the behavior of any other jaguars encountered.\n \nHistory:\n \nScientific Name: Panthera onca\nApprox. Size: Up to 7 ft. long, 200 lb.\nDiet: Deer, cattle, peccary, capybara, monkeys, fish\n \nJaguars are often confused with leopards, another tawny, spotted cat. A distinguising feature of the jaguar is that its spots have small black dots or irregular shapes within rosette patterns. Jaguars are also stockier and have larger heads than leopards. Both jaguars and leopards have melanistic, or black, variants. Without spots, black jaguars can be differentiated from black leopards primarily by their stocky build. Both big cats, whether jaguars or leopards, black or spotted, are commonly, if mistakenly, called panthers.\n \nHistorically, jaguars ranged from the southern parts of North America down to the southern most tip of South America, but their ranges now are in central and northern South America. Jaguars enjoy a rare, unchallenged perch at the top of the wild food chain. In their South American habitat, they have no predators and few real competitors, apart from humans.</string>

    <string _locid="100599">This white wolf is more fierce than is normal and seems wholly unafraid of humans, as if trained and bred for very unwolf-like characteristics.\n \nHistory:\n \nScientific Name: Canis lupus\nApprox. Size: 50-150 lb.\nDiet: Deer, caribou, elk, sheep, small mammals\n \nHistorically, gray wolves could be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic to the tropics. Habitat destruction and hunting have greatly reduced their ranges. They are highly social animals that live and hunt in packs of up to thirty-six individuals led by an alpha male and female. Unrelated immigrants may be adopted into a pack. Packs are generally territorial and patrol their domains against intruders. Except for the red wolf, all living wolves are considered to be part of the C. lupus species. Domestic dogs, including feral subspecies such as dingos, are also classified as wolves. Domestication, perhaps as many as five different times, has lead to significant (but genetically irrelevant) differences between wolves and dogs.</string>

Destroying it will be a serious, and hopefully fatal, blow to the Circle.\n \nHistory:\n \nAn ossuary is a place to store the bones of the dead. Sometimes they are boxes and urns, but often an ossuary is a room or a series of connected rooms beneath the floor of a church. As the bones pile up, industrious faithful folk, often monks, decided to take on the gruesome task of using the bones as decorations for the crypts. Fans of scapulas frame skulls and artfully arranged vertebrae. Chandeliers, niches, chairs, heraldic symbols, and more are replicated in bone. The overall effect is chilling and reverant at the same time.</string>

They are also a source of many unique upgrades either provided by your civilization or unlocked in your Home City and shipped to the New World. Some civilizations, particularly the Ottomans, get a lot of benefit from the improvements here.\n \nHistory:\n \nChurches are places of worship for Christian colonists. Settlers in the New World built churches to provide a place for worship as well as for community events. Religion drove exploration and colonization as people like the Pilgrims left their homes, fleeing persecution, to find religious freedoms in the New World.\n \nA mosque is a place of worship for people of the Islamic faith. The first mosque was located in the holy city of Mecca.  Followers of Islam, called Muslims, are required to pray five times a day. It is preferable that men perform these prayers in a mosque, but the prayers can be performed anywhere if a mosque is not nearby.</string>
    <string _locid="100249">Early passenger cars on American trains were short and carried few passengers. They very much resembled the stagecoaches they replaced. Over time these cars lengthened to accommodate more and more passengers.</string>
    <string _locid="100250">The train travels along a predetermined Trade Route and delivers Experience, Food, Wood, or Coin to any Trading Post it passes. The Trade Route starts as a dirt track and can be improved over the course of a game. The Trade Route appears as a white line on the Mini Map. Any player can build on an unclaimed Trading Post site. Enemy players can own Trading Posts along the same Trade Route.\n \nBuilding a Trading Post along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or increase the speed at which shipments come from the Home City. The locomotive is the last upgrade available for the Trade Route. It delivers goods more quickly than the Stagecoach and Travois.\n \nHistory:\n \nThe first locomotive made in the United States used rifle barrels for the tubes of its boilers. Early steam engines went through several iterations and changes before they adopted their familiar shape.</string>
    <string _locid="100854">The Native Villager is a resource gatherer. Gatherers are relatively inexpensive but fragile; they are not meant for combat, but will fire weak muskets to defend themselves and others. Native Settlers can be used to collect Treasures.\n \nThe longer an individual Native Villager is alive, the more he contributes to the overall wealth of a given colony.\n \nHistory:\n \nHighly industrious and loyal to a fault, the Native Villager lives to work for you. Whether it's chopping down the seventeen thousandth tree, scurrying across the map to a distant pile of silver ore, or endlessly toiling away at a mill, the Native Villager is ready to happily tackle any tedious task. The Villager‚Äôs hobbies include running away from enemy soldiers, getting thrown into the river by enemy cannon fire, and crochet.</string>

Size: Up to 25 ft. long, 4-5 tons\nDiet: plankton\n \nA relative of the blue whale, minkes are one of the smallest baleen whales. Baleen whales feed by filtering sea water through baleen plates on their upper and lower jaws. Minkes are typically dark gray or black with white bellies and bands of white on their flippers. They have loud voices and communicate with rasps and grunts that carry underwater over long distances.\n \nVarieties of Minke Whales are found in nearly every ocean.

    <string _locid="100870">Scientific Name: families Percicthyidae or Centrarchidae\nApprox. Size: varies, up to 3 feet\nDiet: varies\n \nA large number of game fish share the name ‚Äúbass.‚Äù One group of bass, the black bass, is very prevalent throughout the United States, mostly east of the Rocky Mountains. Among the various types of freshwater bass are the largemouth, smallmouth, striped and white, and some unrelated marine species are called bass as well.\n \nSportsmen enjoy fishing for bass because the fish are strong fighters. Bass are known to leap out of the water to catch a lure before it even hits the water. In addition, bass are often fished because their meat is enjoyed due to its firm texture.\n \nMale bass take an active role in the care and raising of young. They build the nest and guard it until the eggs are hatched. They stay and protect the young fish (called ‚Äúfry‚Äù) until they are able to leave the nest on their own.</string>

These fish live in tropical and subtropical waters and are very popular on menus due to their firm and sweet flesh. Their growth rate is high, which allows their populations to be replenished more quickly than many commercial fisheries.\n \nMahi-mahi are brilliantly colored fish that can live up to four years. While alive they flaunt a rainbow of colors from gold to bright blues and greens. Upon death their brilliant colors fade until they are a uniform grayish-yellow.</string>

Beware Fluffy; he‚Äôs even uglier than he looks.\n \nFluffy was discovered running free in the wilds of Texas after brutally killing his owner, Marcin Symansksi. Legend has it that standing in front of a mirror and repeating the words ‚ÄúFluffy, sit! Sit, Fluffy!‚Äù twelve times will cause the dog to appear and chew off one of your legs. Fluffy‚Äôs unfortunate looks are surpassed only by his odor. If you‚Äôre in Texas on a dark night and you smell something foul behind you, run! Don‚Äôt make the same mistake Marcin did.</string>
