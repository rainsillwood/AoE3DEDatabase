    <string _locid="140000">The Ming Dynasty, beginning in 1368 and continuing until 1644, was a period of great stability in China, but also of tightening authority under an autocratic leadership. Its founder was a simple peasant, Zhu Yuanzhanga, a man who spent his formative years in a Buddhist monastery only to abandon those views for a form of neo-Confucianism and a growing mistrust of foreign influence. In the waning years of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, famine, unrest, and bitterness plagued China’s native Han populace, and tempers had reached a breaking point. In the eyes of the people, the once mighty Yuan Dynasty was little more than an illegitimate foreign empire lording over them from afar. Leading a peasant revolt against the Mongols, Zhu Yuanzhanga forced them out of Dadu, present day Beijing, and unified China under him.\n \nTaking the title “Hongwu,” meaning “vast military,” the first emperor of the Ming established his capital in Nanjing and focused his attention on centralizing power, abolishing the office of prime minister and developing a warrior class that ranked higher than any class of civil servant. He also turned his attention to economic recovery and improving peasant life, lowering land taxes, stocking granaries to guard against famine, and maintaining the great rivers of China, the Yellow and the Yangtze. Predictably, his Confucian point of view led him to support the creation of local, agricultural based communities, diminishing the importance of trade with the outside world, and lowering the prestige of merchants as a class.\n \nAlthough his policies benefited the people, encouraging a sharp jump in population due to agricultural reforms, the Hongwu Emperor was often ruled by his own paranoia and ignorance. He constantly feared rebellions and coups, or an invasion by the former Mongol rulers. These suspicions caused him to declare it a capital offense for any advisors to criticize his ideas. Not understanding inflation, he issued paper currency in such large amounts that by 1425 the money was worth 1/70 of its original value, causing a return to copper coins.\n \nThe second ruler of the Ming Dynasty, the Jianwen Emperor, held power for a short four-year reign (1398-1402) before being toppled by his uncle in a coup that ushered in the next great age of China. Zhu Di, the Yongle Emperor, ruled from 1404 to 1424, often called the “Second Founding” of the Ming. “Yongle” means “perpetually jubilant.” During this two-decade period, the capital of China was moved from Nanjing to Beijing, where the newly built Forbidden City became the nucleus of Chinese power and would remain so for the next 500 years. To preserve Chinese culture and literature, the Yongle Emperor commissioned the writing of the "Yongle Encylopedia", one of history’s greatest achievements.\n \nArguably, the most enduring and influential event of the Yongle period was the emperor’s sponsorship of the fabled treasure fleets, China’s only major attempts at seafaring exploration. The seven treasure expeditions began in 1404 and ended in 1424, the year of the emperor’s death. Commanded by the eunuch admiral, Zheng He, the voyages helped to strengthen trade with China’s diplomatic partners in Southeast Asia, and opened new relationships with lands as far west as the coast of Mozambique and Madagascar; and, if some theories are to be believed, the fleets may have even discovered the New World years before Columbus even set sail in search of his route to the Orient.</string>
    <string _locid="140001">The fall of India’s mighty Mughal Empire coincides with the rise of British rule in the subcontinent, occurring in the 18th century; yet even as the British established control, their arrival was little more than the last blow to an already struggling native dynasty. The Mughal Empire, bastion of high culture, geographic expansion, and military might, had fallen.\n \nThe Mughal Empire has its origins in neighboring Afghanistan and Turkestan, where descendents of the Mongol Empire had become Muslims and  where the Muslim ruler Babur began forming the foundations of a new kingdom in 1504 with the seizure of Kabul, and territories leading east into the Indus River Valley. In 1526, he pushed further into India and defeated the last of the Delhi Sultans, Ibrahim Shah Lodi, at the First Battle of Panipat. Babur’s son Humayun succeeded him in 1530, but quickly lost most of the newly won territory. For a time he ruled in exile, but eventually raised an army large enough to march back to Delhi in 1555 and conquer it a second time.\n \nNext in the line of succession was Humayun’s son Akbar, who succeeded his father on 14 February 1556, while in the midst of a war against Sikandar Shah for the reclamation of the Mughal throne. Akbar won his first victory at the age of 13 or 14, and quickly established himself as a confident ruler who had a vision for the future of his empire. He created fair taxes, built an efficient government, placed an emphasis on high culture, and encouraged radical religious tolerance. Because of his contributions, Akbar is considered the greatest of the Mughal rulers.\n \nThe Mughal Empire only lasted for another one hundred years. Its last great ruler was Aurangzeb Alangir, a zealous Muslim who abandoned the tolerance of his predecessors and began to crack down on other faiths, especially the Hindus. During his fifty-year reign, religious prejudice drove a wedge between the ruler and his subjects. Aurang’s intentions were to force the Hindus to convert. Temples were despoiled and a tax for non-Muslims was introduced.\n \nFollowing Aurang, the Mughal Empire suffered from a lack of powerful authority, causing regional nawabs, or governors, to split and found their own kingdoms, such as the Marathas in the south and the Sikhs in the north. The next 27 years of the Mughal Empire were spent in clashes with its neighbors, and in 1739, invading Persian and Afghan armies invaded Delhi.\n \nThe greatest empire in India had crumbled and individual kingdoms rushed to gobble up the pieces. The stage was set for the British, who would overpower the smaller weakened kingdoms and in doing so would gain control of the country.</string>
    <string _locid="140002">The Sengoku, or Warring States period, lasted roughly from 1478 to 1605 and was a time of tremendous social upheaval and political strife in Japan, defined by an almost endless state of war.\n \nThe centralized government of the reigning Ashikaga shogunate had begun to lose the loyalty of many daimyo, or feudal lords, across Japan. Individual provinces were beginning to turn inwards and busy themselves with local matters. This was especially true of those domains far from Kyoto, the center of power.\n \nMany factors contributed to the gradual fragmentation of the shogunate. Trade with China was growing rapidly, developing the Japanese economy and boosting the importance of money to local economies. Commercial cities began to appear across the countryside, and a great desire for local autonomy developed, touching all classes of the social hierarchy. Soon, frustrated over rising taxes and the damage done by famines and earthquakes, peasants began to revolt.\n \nAs chaos began to take hold of the rural villages, unrest broke out in Kyoto, where a dispute over shogunal succession triggered the Onin War (1467–1477). The Hosokawa family and its allies clashed with the Yamana family over the right to wield Japan’s cetral authority. This conflict raged for 11 years, further weakening the role of the shogunate, and it eventually spread out to the waiting powder keg that had become the surrounding provinces.\n \nRegional daimyo suddenly rose up to take control where the central authority had none. During this time, notable clans such as the Takeda and the Imagawa were able to greatly expand their spheres of influence. This was not true of all local lords, however, as many were overtaken by their own subordinates and replaced. This was known as gekokujo, literally translated to mean “the underling conquers the overlord.”\n \nA century passed and the feudal warring continued, even as a possibility for peace grew on the horizon.  Oda Nobunaga, who had emerged from obscurity to seize power over much of central Japan, seemed poised to unite the scrabbling clans into an alliance; but before he could, Nobunaga fell victim to the treachery of one of his own generals in 1582. This left the path to power open for whoever had the ambitions to take it.\n \nOne of Nobunaga’s most trusted underlings, a general and former foot soldier named Toyotomi Hideyoshi, stepped in where his predecessor had left off and continued the work to unify the feuding families. Hideyoshi could never become a true shogun as he was of common birth, but he did consolidate enough power to be named an Imperial Regent by the Emperor of Japan.\n \nAfter several ill-fated invasions of Korea, Hideyoshi died in 1598 without leaving a capable successor to his dynasty. Again, the nation teetered precariously on the edge of chaos.\n \nIt was then that the powerful daimyo of Kanto province, Tokugawa Ieyasu, chose to make his move, one he had been planning for years.\n \n</string>
    <string _locid="140003">The Jesuits are an order of Roman Catholic men who follow the Latin phrase: Ad majorem Dei gloriam, meaning “for the greater glory of God.” The order’s primary goal has been to spread the teachings of the church, and in doing so it has made lasting contributions in the fields of education and scholarship.\n \nFounded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola in 1534 and confirmed by Pope Paul III in 1540, the Jesuits original mission was to travel to the Holy Land and convert all of the Muslims to Christianity, but with the outbreak of war with the Ottoman Empire, the plan never came to fruition. Instead, the order subjected its authority to the will of the Pope and became missionaries wherever they were needed. Missions were established in India and Japan, into the interior of China, and along the coast of Africa. Perhaps the most well known Jesuit missionaries lived and taught in the New World, where they created reductions, village communities under their spiritual guidance and leadership.\n \nAs many in the order voyaged abroad, scores of Jesuits traveled throughout Europe building communities and doing their best to embolden the Counter Reformation movement, strengthening Roman Catholicism and weakening the growing Protestant threat. By 1740, more than 650 Jesuit universities had been founded across the continent, as well as 200 seminaries and academies of religious study.</string>
    <string _locid="140004">The word “sufi” first appeared in the 8th century and is considered to be a reference to the coarse wool garments worn by spiritual men who sought lives of spiritual harmony, free from bodily pleasure and in harmony with nature. The word “sufism” was first used in the 9th century, and became a blanket term for a variety of different forms of Islamic mysticism incorporating such disparate elements as Christian monasticism, gnosticism, and Indian mysticism.\n \nBecause Sufism encompasses a number of belief systems, its origins can be linked to a wide range of geographic regions and periods. However, many consider Sufism to have begun with the practice of Shiite Muslims in the 7th century in what is now Iraq, although others claim that Sufism predates Islam and simply used the other religion as a vehicle for its teachings.\n \nThroughout its long history, Sufism has been criticized for its mystical elements. While it has made significant contributions to the spread of Islam and the development of Islamic culture, conservative Muslims still disagree with its abundance of non-Islamic customs.</string>
    <string _locid="140005">The Udasis are members of a Sikh sect that shares many of the same principles as Sikhism, that of a supreme God who governs with justice and grace, and the opportunity of every human being to become one with that God, while renouncing other practices. The very name “udasi” is from the Sanskrit “udas,” meaning to renounce.\n \nThe Udasi sect was created when the followers of Suri Chand, the son of the very first Sikh guru, Kanek, split from the dominant order of Sikhism. Early Udasis served as Sikh missionaries to the north and east of the Punjab, the Sikh holy land and site of their holiest shrine, the Golden Temple. They insisted that they were in fact Sikh, despite their physical appearance, which did not adhere to the traditional Five K’s of the Sikh: a sword, steel bracelet, long shorts, uncut hair, and comb. Other, more drastic differences, such as celibacy and a dedication to ascetic principals, forsaking bodily needs and desires for a disciplined, monastic spirituality, helped to define the sect and set it apart.\n \n</string>
    <string _locid="140006">Zen is a school of Buddhism that seeks a form of enlightenment achieved by the Buddha, a title that began with the very first Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, an Indian prince who abandoned his life of luxury to pursue an ascetic life. The goal of Zen is to eventually reach enlightenment through the Four Noble Truths: existence is suffering; desire is its cause; the cessation of suffering is possible; and the way to accomplish this is to follow the Eightfold Path.\n \nIn the year 520 AD, a legendary Indian monk named Bodhidharma brought the teachings of Zen, then called Chan, to the Chinese. Chan Buddhists worked to see the world just as it is, with a mind free of thoughts or feelings. This perception was called “no-mind, or “wu-shin” in Chinese. Chan split into two separate schools, the Southern school, which believed in sudden enlightenment, and the Northern school, which believed in a more gradual process. Only the Northern school survived through the 8th century. By the 12th century, Zen had flourished in Japan, and by the 20th century it had gained adherents in the West.\n \nToday, Zen Buddhism is practiced by millions of people around the world. The tenets remain the same, that the potential to reach enlightenment lies in every human being, but is blocked by ignorance. Only intense study, meditation, doing good deeds, conducting rites, and the worship of images will enable the breakthrough required to shed limited perceptions and achieve a spiritual awakening.</string>
    <string _locid="140007">Hinduism’s Bhakti movement is unique in that it emphasizes the love of a devotee for his or her personal god, a dualistic relationship between the worshipper and the worshipped. The devotee may praise his or her chosen deity as child, parent, friend, master, or beloved. In bhakti, it is the inner feelings as opposed to institutional religion that form the core of a person’s faith.\n \nBhakti sects and cults have been traced back to the 1st century AD, with similar theistic practices dated as far back as the "Bhagavad-Gita", written in 150 BCE. It is common for most Hindu gods to have their own sects, but bhakti often centers on Shiva and Vishnu, and the Vishnu incarnations of Rama and Krishna. Repetition of the god’s name is a significant practice in bhakti, as is wearing his emblem, singing, and making pilgrimages. In the 7th through 10th centuries, bhakti became increasingly prevalent due to the widespread work of poets and artists who created new forms of non-ritualistic worship, portraying the relationship between man and god in human terms, and thus making it more relatable.</string>
    <string _locid="140008">The treasure voyages of the Ming Dynasty lasted for two decades and had the Chinese civilization poised on the cusp of a significantly enhanced world role. Within twenty years, from 1405 to 1433, the Chinese navy had become the supreme naval power of Southeast Asia, and helped to establish diplomatic and trade links with more than thirty-seven countries reaching as far west as the coast of Africa, between what is now Mozambique and Madagascar.\n \nThe grand treasure voyages were helmed by the now legendary figure of Admiral Zheng He, a Chinese Muslim, and one of the emperor’s eunuch admirals. In addition to acting as admiral to fleets numbering as many as 300 ships, Zheng He filled the role of diplomat, trader, conqueror, and even explorer, as he expanded the reach of the Chinese Middle Kingdom to destinations unknown…and those only hinted at by imagination. A man of humble means and background, Zheng He succeeded in his role as naval commander and is today considered one of China’s greatest historical figures.\n \nVirtual cities, the treasure fleets were composed of a variety of different Chinese junks. Crews numbered in the tens of thousands, with experts of every discipline on hand to provide the leadership with whatever expertise or skill was desired, from astrologers to interpret the stars, to animal handlers to corral and care for exotic species acquired during the long voyages. Farmers manned special agriculture ships that worked like movable farms, cultivating crops to feed the many thousands of mouths. There was even a cadre of Imperial soldiers to escort the galaxy of ships wherever it sailed.\n \nAccording to the records, the largest ships in the fleet were technological marvels that were far ahead of their time. Sailing with nine masts, these ships reached over 400 feet in length and 185 feet in width, and displaced approximately 3,100 tons of water, dwarfing any European vessels of the period. Watertight bulkheads contained drinking water, and could become storage compartments for housing sea animals. They also helped to keep the massive vessels afloat in the event the hulls were breached.\n \nThe first treasure expedition was launched in 1405, and made port in Java, Sumatra, Sri Lanka, Calicut, Malacca, Quilon, and other destinations. It delivered so many goods to these Indian ports that pricing them took more than three months. Subsequent voyages grew more expensive, and increasingly far-reaching. As a result, the number of soldiers traveling with the expeditions’ merchants and explorers also began to balloon, and at one point a voyage to India including only forty-five ships was supposedly guarded by well over 30,000 Chinese soldiers. Most historians believe that by 1433 the Chinese had reached as far as the coast of Madagascar; while others have posited less accepted theories that envision the Chinese landing as far west as the coast of the Americas, some seventy years before Christopher Columbus’ 1492 expedition.\n \nMany factors supposedly contributed to the sudden end of the Ming treasure fleets. The death of the visionary Yongle Emperor in 1424 allowed for the rise of his conservative opponents who had for decades longed to seize power and install a Confucian system that focused on domestic development and isolation. Also, the creation of the Grand Canal running north to south through China enabled the transportation of goods without the necessity of an ocean route. For whatever reason, conservative forces under the new Emperor Hongxi canceled further treasure expeditions. The mighty fleet that had once commanded the seas was sunk, and the records of its exploits burned. By the end of the fifteenth century it was a capital offense in China to build a ship with more than two masts.</string>
    <string _locid="140009">Daimyo Tokugawa Ieyasu never intended to become the supreme ruler of Japan. Yet, this was the future left to him following the bitter and bloody battles of the Sekigahara campaign, a conflict that engulfed the ruling classes of Japan in a feud for power, and ended in a military dictatorship that would last for more than 200 years.\n \n It took twelve years for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a feudal daimyo turned Imperial minister, to consolidate the territories of Japan into a proper hegemony, a feat only marred by his failed attempts to invade Korea in the final years of his life. Still, even as his health waned and his power grew threatened by eminent death, Hideyoshi took steps to insure his family’s claim to power. In 1598, the year he died, Hideyoshi appointed a group of feudal lords, the Five Regents, to watch over his young heir and protect the boy’s interests until adulthood. Unfortunately, all of these men had ambitions and agendas of their own, and none more so than Tokugawa Ieyasu, the most powerful of all the remaining daimyo.\n \nWith Hideyoshi’s death, Ieyasu quickly moved into position to fill the power vacuum, forming provocative alliances and occupying several regions and fortresses, including Fushimi Castle, a stark symbol of Hideyoshi’s former power. The other regents watched Ieyasu’s actions with increasing concern, suspicious of his brashness and disrespect. Within just a few months, unified Japan began to split apart with provincial lords drifting to the support of the two sides: Ieyasu’s eastern army and a western army commanded by Hideyoshi’s former administrative minister Ishida Mitsunari, who chose to remain loyal to the Toyotomi dynasty.\n \nWhile Mistunari’s motives were unclear, many believed that the former administrative minister, who was known more for his adherence to ceremonial duties than his skill on a battlefield, was in his own way hoping to claim a piece of the shattered power left in the wake of Hideyeoshi’s death. But few of Mitsunari’s generals had confidence in his leadership, and it was this lack of faith that proved his undoing. In a period rife with treachery and meaningless alliances, Mistunari did possess enough charisma to draw pivotal generals away from the powerful Ieyasu and to the loyalist cause. In the end, Ieyasu’s leadership and vision convinced many generals from the enemy camp to betray their loyalties and join him, often at a crucial moment in battle.\n \nAfter two years of bloody skirmishes across central Japan, the two sides prepared for a final, decisive confrontation; but no one was sure where exactly it would occur, or when. In October 1600, the Battle of Sekigahara erupted on the muddy ground below the Mountains of Sasao, Matsuo, and Nangu, outside the village of Sekigahara in the northern region of central Japan. Fate had chosen no side in this epic struggle, as both forces rode into the fray unsure of which was the stronger, and which possessed the overall advantage.\n \nAt the end of that rainy, foggy day, Ieyasu’s army had taken more than 60,000 enemy heads, and the loyalist army had ceased to exist. With the whole of the country at his feet, Tokugawa Ieyasu began to reward those who had shown him their loyalty, just as he had once promised to remain loyal to the deceased Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\n \nIn 1603, Ieyasu was named Shogun by the emperor of Japan, officially beginning the reign of the Tokugawa family shoguns, also known as the Edo Period. It would last until the year 1868. </string>
    <string _locid="140010">The First War of Indian Independence, as it is known in common Indian discourse, goes by many names, all of them controversial: The War of Independence of 1857, Indian Mutiny, the Great Indian Mutiny, the Sepoy Rebellion, the Great Mutiny, the Rebellion of 1857, the Revolt of 1857, and the Uprising. The debate over the title is a result of many known atrocities committed on both sides of the conflict, by soldiers of the British East India Company, and by fighters of the Indian resistance movements. Supporters of the title Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 claim that no unified Indian government existed and thus the scattered uprisings did not constitute a traditional army. It is also well documented that Indian soldiers drawn from a variety of armies and factions - including the Bengal Army, Madras Army, Bombay Army, and Sikh regiments - fought for the British forces during the struggle. However, supporters of the title First War of Indian Independence, most of them native Indian, insist that the rebelling sepoy soldiers fought for a countrywide rule by the old Mughal Empire, a national symbol of united Indian might. To this day, the debate over the title and of the struggle’s significance rages on.\n \nThe conflict had its roots in the centuries old practices of the British East India Company, a business created for the precise goal of exploiting trade with the countries of the East Indies and Southeast Asia. Incorporated on December 31, 1600, the East India Company was given free reign over its holdings in the region and the right to establish a trade monopoly by the British Crown. By 1689 it had set aside administrative districts called presidencies in the Indian provinces of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. By 1784 the East India Company had become so powerful that the British government created the India Act, which established an official department to exercise political, military, and financial control over the company’s Indian affairs.\n \nIn the years that followed, the East India Company suffered great financial difficulties and reached a point where if they were to increase revenue, they needed to expand British territories in South Asia. So the British government began to arrange adoption rights of native Indian princes and began massive annexation of more than a dozen independent Indian kingdoms. 80,000 square miles of land with a combined population of four to five million people were forcibly seized. The only way to manage and control these new holdings was to establish a permanent army of 200,000 South Asians under the command of 40,000 British soldiers. The concept of independent Indian states had disappeared.\n \nThe flashpoint for the clash between native South Asian soldiers, or sepoys, and their British commanders is believed to have been a conflict over the new Lee-Enfield Rifle, introduced to soldiers in 1857. The rifle was developed at the Enfield arsenal by James P. Lee and it fired a .303 caliber ammunition that needed to be manually loaded before firing. Loading required the rifleman to bite the end of the cartridge, which was greased in pig fat and beef tallow. This presented a problem for native soldiers, as pig fat is a forbidden substance to Muslims, while cow fat is a forbidden substance for Hindus. This affront to the diverse cultures of the native troops perfectly symbolized more than a hundred years of British oppression and disrespect.\n \nAfter several months of tension, full-scale resistance finally broke out on May 9, 1857. While stationed in the city of Meerut, the sepoy soldiers of the 11th and 20th native cavalry of the Bengal Army turned on their commanding officers. From that day until June of 1858, when the uprising was quelled and British authority reestablished, the future of India was anyone’s guess. </string>
    <string _locid="140011">Considered to be the greatest of India’s Mughal emperors, Akbar (Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar) acted as both a prophet and a conqueror during his forty-five-year rule. He was the son of Humayun, and grandson of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. Akbar began his rule as a child, rising to power under the guidance of a regent who expanded the realm significantly until the boy ruler dismissed him in 1560, when Akbar turned eighteen.\n \nEnergetic and confident, Akbar continued the policies of imperial expansion, enlarging the Mughal Empire to include Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and almost the entire Indian peninsula north of the Godavari River. Yet, even as he defeated numerous chieftains and warlords, Akbar made sure to sow the seeds of future peace, offering conciliatory opportunities to those he brought under the rule of the Mughal Empire. Upon conquering the fierce Hindu Rajputs, Akbar reached out to them, placing many of their chiefs in positions of influence within his own administration; he even went so far as to twice marry a Rajput princess.\n \nAkbar’s overall goal was to create a utopian society with him as its ruler and divine counselor. He established a uniform system of government that unified the scattered and diverse regions and kingdoms of his domain. His courts at Delhi and Agra became centers of education and cultural achievement. And in perhaps the most unusual and ambitious of his policies, Akbar, having grown disillusioned with traditional Islam, promoted a religious tolerance movement that focused on open spiritual debate. He even created a new faith combining aspects of Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. He called this all-encompassing spirituality “The Faith of the Divine.”\n \nAkbar is remembered as a visionary ruler for good reason. His strength as a military commander was tempered with a strong sense of respect towards all subjects that he absorbed into his growing empire. While eccentric, his ideas were startlingly ahead of their time. \n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Akbar the Great is the judicious and forward-thinking ruler that he was in life. He will take longer than some leaders to amass his troops and attack, trading speed for preparation. Akbar mainly fields cavalry armies and jumps at the opportunity to establish Trading Posts on Trade Routes as early as possible.</string>
    <string _locid="140012">At 61 years, the reign of the Kangxi Emperor is the longest of any ruler in China’s history. As second emperor of the Qing Dynasty, the Kangxi Emperor won the respect of a Chinese populous still widely suspicious of its Manchu rulers. Although he was an advocate of neo-Confucianism, his beliefs did not keep him from opening ports for trade with other nations, and even welcoming foreign missionaries, such as the Jesuits, into his kingdom. In his 61 years of rule, the Kangxi proved to be a stable and beloved ruler, strengthening domestic policies and extending his empire past its borders into Mongolia, Tibet, and Taiwan.\n \nThe Kangxi Emperor was born Aixin-Jueluo Xuanye, on May 4, 1654. He ascended the throne in 1662, at the age of seven, twelve days after the death of his father the Shunzhi Emperor. At first the young ruler had no hand in governing his country. Before his death, Kangxi’s father had appointed four regents to make decisions in the boy’s stead. However, at almost the moment these men tasted their newfound power, they turned on each other. One died, one was murdered, and one tried to usurp the young Kangxi Emperor as the supreme ruler of the Qing. Having stood by and watched long enough, the teenaged emperor stepped in and took control in 1669.\n \nFrom that point on, the Kangxi Emperor worked hard to please his people, believing that even the smallest act of carelessness could cause grave, empire-wide repercussions. He worked tirelessly to win their goodwill and overturn years of bitterness from those still loyal to the preceding Ming Dynasty. He toured the south of the country with a small, humble entourage, educating himself about local conditions and concerns, and reasserting his rule among regional leaders. In 1670 the Kangxi Emperor issued the Sacred Edict, which consisted of sixteen moral maxims that were based on Confucian teachings. They encouraged respect for parents and ancestors, generosity, frugality, hard work, and the importance of taxes to the community and the empire. With this act, he proved himself to be a true Chinese emperor; despite his ethnic Manchu background, he was sensitive to the needs and cultures of the Chinese people.\n \nUntil his death in 1722, the Kangxi Emperor ruled in such a way as to make him remembered as one of China’s most capable of adroit leaders, and the greatest of the Qing Dynasty emperors. He orchestrated the Treaty of Nerchinsk with Russia, adding parts of Outer Mongolia and Tibet to China's domain. He ordered the repair of China’s Grand Canal to allow for easier transportation of rice to the hungry northern populations. He dredged the Yellow River to prevent destructive flooding. He reduced taxes and commissioned the creation of important texts, including the “Kangxi Dictionary” and a written history of the Ming Dynasty. But perhaps the Kangxi Emperor’s most creative accomplishment was learning to “tickle the ivory,” as he was the first Chinese ruler to play a Western instrument - the piano. \n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, the Kangxi Emperor prioritizes defense, matching his focus on domestic policy in life. He is unlikely to attack his enemies early in the game, but when he does prepare for battle, he raises vast armies primarily composed of infantry units.</string>
    <string _locid="140013">Born in war, Tokugawa Ieyasu thrived on conflict, rising to such prominence that his very name has become associated with one of Japan’s most powerful and significant eras. His given name was Matsudaira Takechiyo. At the time of his birth, his parents were only 15 and 17 years old, and in less than two years, his mother was dismissed and the couple separated permanently. With his mother gone, Takechiyo quickly became embroiled in the brutal affairs of his father’s family, the Matsudaira clan.\n \nDuring Takechiyo’s childhood, the Matsudaira was torn in its allegiance. Half of the family wished to side with the Imagawa clan, while the other side preferred the Oda clan. In 1548, when the Oda clan invaded their province, Takechiyo’s father went to the Imagawa clan for help. The leader of the Imagawa agreed to aid the Matsidaira clan, but on one condition: that young Takechiyo, a six-year-old boy, be given as a hostage. His father agreed. But before the exchange could be carried out, the leader of the Oda clan learned of the arrangement and had the boy abducted en route to his destination. The Oda threatened to kill the boy if Matsudaira did not sever his ties with the Imagawa, their sworn enemy. The boy’s father refused. He believed his actions would prove his loyalty to his ally, even at the expense of his own son. Takechiyo stayed with the Oda for three years, until their castle was besieged by the Imagawa and he was given to them as incentive to cease their attack. Ever since his birth, the boy had been little more than a pawn in the affairs of those around him.\n \nIn 1567, Matsudaira Takechiyo changed his given name to Ieyasu, and took the surname Tokugawa, thus claiming descent from the imperial Minamoto clan, although no proof supporting this connection has ever been discovered. By taking this name, Ieyasu made his ambitions quite clear. Not only did he distance himself from his past, but he also hinted at a confident and commanding future. By that time he was the veteran of many wars and had gained a reputation as a fearless and crafty general, prone to taking the best advantage of shifting alliances and family rifts. He had used his alliances to build up his territory and gain influence, allying first with the powerful Oda Nobunaga, and then with Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was slowly uniting the warring clans into a tenuous coalition. Hen Hideyoshi invaded Korea in the 1590s; Ieyasu wisely chose not to participate, and instead focused on domestic production and organizing his army. While other generals sent their men to die in the disastrous invasions, Ieyasu waited and watched.\n \nWhen Hideyoshi died in 1598, his lands suddenly became targets for all of his former enemies turned allies, and none of these men were as powerful as Tokugawa Ieyasu. During the legendary Sekigahara campaign (1598-1600), Ieyasu and those loyal to him defeated the army of loyalists who had sworn to protect the dynasty of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. At the Battle of Sekigahara in October 1600, Ieyasu claimed ultimate victory, executing his enemies and rewarding his friends.\n \nTwo years later he received the title of shogun and established the Tokugawa Shogunate, ushering in the Edo period, a military dictatorship that lasted until 1868.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu is the aggressive, opportunistic leader that he was in life. He attacks early and often, and prefers to invest in military units rather than establish Trading Posts on Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="140014">The smallest of Indian elephant units is the Flail Elephant. While not as rugged or versatile as other elephant units, it is highly effective against buildings, making it a powerful siege weapon. It can be trained at a Castle.</string>
    <string _locid="140015">Although there are few accounts to substantiate its existence, the flail elephant was said to have been a cavalry and siege unit fielded with the early armies of Sri Lanka. It would enter battle whirling a heavy iron chain that had been affixed to its trunk, becoming both a terrifying and entirely unapproachable force.</string>
    <string _locid="140016">The Chinese flamethrower is a Chinese siege weapon that fires a continuous stream of flame, incinerating enemy infantry and burning down enemy buildings from short range. It can be built at a Castle, as an individual unit or as part of the Black Flag Banner Army.</string>
    <string _locid="140017">The flamethrower was the first use of gunpowder in warfare, before it was imbued with enough saltpeter to explode. The Chinese flamethrower design, the Pen Huo Qi, was based on a seventh-century Byzantine model, which featured an inconsistent spurting action. The Chinese desired a more continuous flame, and achieved it by developing a dual bellows system. Two bellows allowed for the creation of an unbroken stream of the chemical fuel naphtha, which could then be ignited.\n \nThe Chinese flamethrower was used both as a defensive weapon and a siege unit. It was often fixed on a wall, positioned to fire down on incoming soldiers and siege weapons. However, the most common depiction of the flamethrower portrays it as mounted on a four-wheeled pushcart. This mobility most likely allowed the flamethrower to be used on the battlefield, to deter enemy attacks, as well as to project a shield of flame for advancing soldiers. </string>
    <string _locid="140018">The Flaming Arrow is a light Japanese cannon that fires its namesake, a flaming arrow that wreaks havoc on enemy infantry and siege units. It can be constructed at a Castle.</string>
    <string _locid="140019">The flaming arrow was exactly what its name suggests, a barbed projectile fired, in most cases, from a European cannon, as the Japanese had not developed effective artillery of their own. Each arrow was wrapped with a flammable covering and ignited. There was also a more explosive version, on which gunpowder was encased in a ball located just below the barbed tip. When fired, a flaming arrow would bury itself in the wood of a gate or wall and burn, hopefully setting the whole structure ablaze.\n \nJapanese daimyo, Tokugawa Ieyasu, had a keen interest in building more advanced artillery for his armies. He leveraged his connections with English and Dutch traders to import a variety of European model cannons. It is believed that he utilized these weapons, as well as the flaming arrow, in sieges during the famous Sekigahara campaign of 1600 that eventually led to the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate.</string>
    <string _locid="140020">The Flying Crow is a powerful piece of Chinese artillery that resembles a great black bird carrying a payload of explosives. It is most effective against buildings and ships, and has long range and a large damage area. Unlike most artillery units, the Flying Crow automatically upgrades as a player Ages up. It can only be trained from the Chinese Wonder, the Confucian Academy, or shipped in from a Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140021">The first recorded uses of such a rocket-propelled weapon occurred in 969 CE. The flying crow was an evolution of this early rocket technology, and was utilized as both a physical and psychological weapon. Its two wings allowed for natural lift and stabilization and also acted as carriage for the four rockets (two under each wing) that propelled the weapon through the air. At a certain stage of flight, the rockets would flare up and ignite the gunpowder within. The flying crow was said to fly to heights above 1,000 feet and eventually crash into the ground. Detonating near an enemy encampment, it sent a rain of fire down upon its targets.\n \nThe flying crow was constructed of bamboo laths, much like a basket, and then covered with paper to strengthen its shape. Two variations on this avian theme have been recorded in the history of Chinese siege warfare, the “flying crow with magic fire,” a larger model with four-rocket propulsion, and the “spiritual flying duck,” a smaller model using only two rockets.</string>
    <string _locid="140022">The Hand Mortar is a Chinese siege weapon that fires explosive shells. When massed, they are excellent against enemy siege, buildings, and ships. Because the Hand Mortar is quite portable, it does not require many population slots. It can be trained from a Castle, as an individual unit or as part of the Mongolian Banner Army.</string>
    <string _locid="140023">The earliest use of exploding bombs dates back to 1044, when bombs were encased in paper and generally used to create a distraction, or to startle soldiers and cavalry horses. The first Chinese hand mortar used specifically for firing iron-cased bombs was found in 1413. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the hand-thrown bomb became more common in battle, and eventually the Chinese began to use it as mortar ammunition, replacing spherical stones as the projectile of choice.\n \nThe hand mortar was highly mobile and its fuse could be shortened and lengthened in accordance with the kind of bomb it was firing. Because of the diversity of bombs developed by Chinese and Korean armies, a hand mortar could cause a wide variety of effects, making it a very adaptable, and very dangerous, siege weapon.</string>
    <string _locid="140024">The Morutaru, or Japanese Mortar, is a Japanese siege weapon similar to the Chinese and Korean Mortars, and fires highly explosive shells. It can only be used against buildings and ships, but is highly effective. The Morutaru can be trained from the Castle.</string>
    <string _locid="140025">In the late sixteenth century, when armies of Japan returned from their military campaigns on the Korean peninsula, they brought with them many lessons in siege acquired from their sophisticated Korean enemy. Unfortunately, use of the mortar, a military art that the Koreans had perfected, was something in which the Japanese did not appear interested. They continued their usual practice of importing European cannons. However, in 1639 the Japanese played host to visiting Dutch advisors who demonstrated a mortar for the Shogun and his representatives. The demonstration caused an uproar even though not one shell fired hit its intended target.</string>
    <string _locid="140026">The Siege Elephant is an incredibly tough Indian siege unit. It is essentially a Culverin mounted on the back of an elephant. It does massive damage to buildings, ships, and other siege. It can be trained at a Castle.</string>
    <string _locid="140027">The training of elephants started in the Indus Valley located between India and Pakistan about 4,000 years ago. Elephants had many different military uses both on and off the battlefield. Females were often used as pack animals, while males were equipped and ridden into combat. The thickness of an elephant’s hide was natural protection against projectiles, such as arrows, while its incredible strength allowed it to trample incoming infantry and startle cavalry. Generals and officers often used elephants to gain a heightened view of the battlefield, enabling better tactical movement. The use of war elephants spread west from India as western rulers incorporated them into their armies. The most notable example of this was when the Carthaginian warlord, Hannibal, used war elephants against the Romans in 264 BCE.\n \nWhile elephants were not very effective as siege weapons, many armies tried to capitalize on the beast’s strength or size when attacking enemy fortifications. In some instances, the elephant’s strength and tusks alone were enough to topple a wall. In other situations, light cannon, such as culverins, were mounted on the Howdah, or carriage, that was secured atop an elephant’s back.</string>
    <string _locid="140028">The Howdah is a sturdy Indian cavalry unit featuring a carriage full of archers that fire devastating long-range attacks. Other cavalry units are no match for the Howdah’s strength and toughness. It does great damage to cavalry, artillery, and siege units. The Howdah can be trained at a Caravanserai.</string>
    <string _locid="140029">Howdah is the traditional name for a carriage that is strapped across an elephant’s back, allowing it to carry human riders, including the “mahout,” the beast’s human handler. Howdahs often featured grand decoration and were used as processional carriages. Early Mughal rulers preferred travel by elephant because of the impression it made, both during peacetime and at war. Although elephants have been used in warfare for centuries, the Mauryan Empire of ancient India first used the howdah in combat in about 300 BCE. Soon afterwards, elephant howdahs provided safety to many Carthaginian archers and javelineers during the Punic Wars of 264-146 BCE.\n \nIn battle, elephants with ornate howdahs acted as standard bearers, visual representations of the army’s might. More importantly, they provided a relatively safe location from which ranged units could gain a more expansive view of the battlefield and fire on their enemy from above. From this elevated vantage point, they could choose their targets more effectively. </string>
    <string _locid="140030">The Iron Flail is a Chinese heavy cavalry unit that wields the iron flail weapon. It is a strong cavalry unit with many hitpoints and a high resistance to ranged attacks. In close combat, the Iron Flail causes much melee damage and has a powerful trample attack. The Iron Flail is part of the Forbidden Army and the Imperial Army, and can be trained at the Chinese War Academy.</string>
    <string _locid="140031">The flail is a medieval weapon used primarily in Europe during the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries. Its construction consists of a weighted head, often spiked, that is attached to a wooden handle with a whip or length of chain. While not as commonly used in Asia, the flail was quite similar to other flail weapons, such as the Chinese nunchaku, or two-section staff, and Sanjiegun, or three-section staff. </string>
    <string _locid="140032">The Keshik is a Chinese horse archer with fewer hitpoints than other archers. Its arrows cause a greater amount of damage to enemy targets. The Keshik is part of the Ming Army and the Mongolian Army and can be trained at the Chinese War Academy.</string>
    <string _locid="140033">The mounted archers of the Mongolian Empire, the largest contiguous empire in human history, were feared for their mastery of the composite bow and their use of unpredictable light cavalry tactics. Using composite bows fashioned from a combination of materials, such as wood and animal bone, and held together with an animal hide adhesive, the keshik horsemen could fire arrows up to a range greater than 1,000 feet. They often carried two bows, one for short-range attacks and the other for distance volleys, and their quivers could contain a variety of different arrows for different purposes, including incendiary arrows, armor-piercing arrows, and whistling arrows to startle enemy units and throw them into a panic.\n \nThe keshik were renowned for their ability to maneuver and shoot while on horseback, often turning a full 360 degrees to aim and fire on an enemy target. Charging the enemy in a traditional crescent formation, they would attempt to flank and surround the enemy. If this tactic failed, they would quickly pull back, often feigning retreat in an effort to lure their enemy into a trap.\n \nMore than simple warriors, the keshik were an elite imperial guard created by Genghis Khan himself, a fierce fighting force that began with the 1,000 warriors of his personal guard and grew to an army numbering 10,000 men. During wartime, the keshik were under direct control of the emperor who only rode to war with the keshik at his side. As a royal guard, the keshik’s peacetime activities were mostly administrative. They supervised palace staff, cared for the equine, and maintained careful care of weapons and other supplies.</string>
    <string _locid="140034">The Mahout Lancer is an Indian melee cavalry unit that moves faster than any other elephant. It is extremely resilient, able to move in close to infantry and fight for long periods without depleting its high number of hitpoints. Its trample attack inflicts great area damage against infantry. The Mahout Lancer can be trained at a Caravanserai.</string>
    <string _locid="140035">Mahout is the traditional name for one who trains and handles a domesticated elephant, a practice that has occurred for more than 3,000 years. In Hindu culture, elephants were highly respected as a manifestation of the elephant god Ganesh, the god of good luck. Having elephants participate in a festival or procession was required for every celebratory occasion, and being the mahout who cared for a great elephant on such an occasion was a great honor.\n \nOften considered the natural predecessor of the modern-day tank, the elephant brought many unique elements to its role as a battlefield unit. Early successes had more to do with surprise and intimidation than battlefield effectiveness. Enemy horses or camels, whether frightened by the beast’s smell, or overwhelmed by its sheer size, proved powerless against the elephant. It trampled oncoming waves of infantry and knocked riders from their mounts, scattering ranks and causing general confusion. It had a similar effect on the human enemy, terrifying many men to the point of panic. Yet, as armies became more accustomed to fighting elephants in battle, the methods of how to defeat them became evident.\n \nThe most famous event involving a triumph over elephants occurred in 1398, when the Mongol conqueror Timur invaded India to overthrow the Delhi Sultanate. At a loss for how to fight back against the Indian’s elephants, Timur prayed to Allah for guidance. Then, according to legend, he attached straw to the backs of the camels in his army and sent them out to fight. When the camels neared the elephants, Timur had his men ignite the straw. The sight of the stampeding, flaming camels spooked the elephants so badly that they ended up crushing many Indian troops in their rush to escape.</string>
    <string _locid="140036">The Meteor Hammer is a Chinese heavy cavalry unit that wields the deadly meteor hammer chain weapon. Because of the length of its weapon, the Meteor Hammer causes great damage against siege units. The Meteor Hammer is part of the Forbidden Banner Army and can be trained at the Chinese War Academy.</string>
    <string _locid="140037">Classified as a martial arts chain weapon, the meteor hammer evolved from ancient Chinese hunting weapons and basically consists of two weights connected by a rope or a chain. The “hammer” is a small ball of bronze about the size of a duck’s egg, and the chain can vary in length, from 6 to 15 feet. The meteor hammer offers an unparalleled level of speed when striking, and can be utilized in different attack styles depending on the conditions of the battlefield: thrown, swung, or whipped. The most skillful wielder can wrap the chain around a number of body parts before unwrapping it to release the hammer with a jolt of accumulated energy. This causes the hammer to shoot forward with such speed that it strikes a target with deadly force. It is this burst of speed that earned the weapon its name. If space did not allow for this kind of combat, the meteor hammer could be modified to ensnare the weapon of an enemy attacker, or to strangle an enemy from a distance.</string>
    <string _locid="140038">The Naginata Rider is a mounted warrior wielding the deadly naginata. A non-traditional cavalry unit, it does great damage to archers and skirmishers, but is very weak against anti-cavalry. The Naginata Rider can be trained at the Stable. </string>
    <string _locid="140039">The naginata is an ancient Japanese weapon that was used widely during Japan’s feudal period. It is often compared to the European halberd, or pike, and is little more than a 1-2 foot curved sword blade fastened to the end of a long oak handle. The dimensions of the weapon are often dependent on personal preference and battlefield conditions. Despite its simplicity, the naginata is difficult to brandish and even more difficult to master. Naginata-jutsu is the art of wielding the naginata, a practice that is still studied today.\n \nWhen it first appeared, the naginata was usually used by attendants to samurai and by sohei warrior monks. It was effective at disabling enemy cavalry units from a short distance. However, with the dawn of gunpowder weapons, the naginata rapidly lost its importance and was often left behind when men ventured off to battle. This is how the naginata became a symbolic object for Japanese women, since it was the primary weapon with which they had to defend their homes and families. It was also the weapon of choice for female samurai, including the legendary Hangaku, a beautiful and deadly warrior who was said to wield a naginata in combat.\n \nToday, naginata-jutsu is widely considered a feminine art, the weapon seen as a symbol of a woman’s devotion to her family. More Japanese women than men practice it.</string>
    <string _locid="140040">The Sowar is a heavy cavalry unit that brandishes a powerful talwar saber from atop a camel. It is especially good against archers and skirmishers. Its speed is perhaps the Sowar’s greatest asset, as it is able to cover great distances in a short duration. It can be trained at the Caravanserai. </string>
    <string _locid="140041">In Persian, the word “sowar” literally means “the one who rides.” During the British East India Company’s occupation of the Indian subcontinent, “sowar” was used in reference to native cavalry units in the Company’s employ. These mounted soldiers were considered the equivalent of sepoy infantry soldiers, and they were often utilized as escorts and guards.</string>
    <string _locid="140042">The Steppe Rider is a Chinese heavy cavalry unit that is cheap, fast, and good at siege. It has far fewer hitpoints than other cavalry units. Attacking in force the Steppe Rider is powerful against villagers and buildings. The Steppe Rider is part of the Standard Banner Army and can be trained at the Chinese War Academy. </string>
    <string _locid="140043">The Mongol army of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was one of the most effective fighting forces of all time, centering its battlefield strategy on the tenets of flexibility, mobility, and siege. Clad in light armor, horse archers rode and fought independently of cumbersome supply lines, collecting valuable reconnaissance information as they disrupted enemy positions and sowed seeds of panic. Their tactic of swift advances and false retreats often left the steppe riders out of harm’s way but within arrow range for their attack. As the warriors attacked, mounted couriers relayed messages across various fronts and within the combined army, which consisted of a variety of different units working together.\n \nWhen the Mongols prepared for a final siege, they brought engineers to the front. Siege engines and rockets were deployed to scatter enemy formations, and to isolate pockets of troops to keep supplies or reinforcements from reaching them.	</string>
    <string _locid="140044">The Yabusame Archer is an elite Japanese light cavalry unit that fires a bow from very long range. It is more powerful than most other cavalry archers due to its long range and the bonus damage it inflicts on siege units. The Yabusame Archer can be trained at the Stable.</string>
    <string _locid="140045">Yabusame is the ancient art of archery, or Kyudo, while riding on horseback. “Kyudo” is Japanese for “Way of the Bow.” The history of Yabusame is rooted in legend, beginning around 530 CE, when it is believed that the 29th emperor of Japan, Kinmei, prayed for "Tenka-taihei" (peace) and "Gokoku-houjyou" (good harvest) and then fired from horseback at three targets. The art of Yabusame has never strayed far from its roots and even today is perceived foremost as a ritual honoring the gods and calling forth their blessings.\n \nMinamoto No Yoritomo, first of Japan’s feudal shoguns, had great respect for the art of Yabusame and worked to establish it as a part of standard military training and practice. During his reign, Minamoto established the Ogasawara School, a specialized institution for teaching the arts of foot and mounted archery. He also started the Tsurugaoka Hachimanguu Yabusame Divine Performance, a showcase for the most highly talented Yabusame Archers. The first event was held on August 15, 1187. Since that day the ceremony has been held every year to the present, although it went on temporary hiatus during the Pacific conflicts of World War II.</string>
    <string _locid="140046">The Zamburak is an Indian light cavalry unit. It’s extremely fast and cheap but has fewer hitpoints than other cavalry units. Its mounted gun gives the Zamburak good range, and it inflicts the worst damage on heavy cavalry. It can be trained at the Caravanserai.</string>
    <string _locid="140047">A zamburak is a small weapon carried on and fired from the back of a camel. The name comes from the Arabic “zambur,” meaning hornet. Before gunpowder, early versions of the camel-mounted gun featured a bolt-firing crossbow that produced a buzzing twang at discharge, which gave the weapon its name. In later years the crossbow was replaced with a small culverin or falconet attached to the rider’s saddle. The zamburak originated in Egypt, and spread to Iran, India and elsewhere. Attempts to adapt the idea to elephants proved generally unsuccessful, as the beasts would not remain steady under intense enemy fire.</string>
    <string _locid="140048">The Arquebusier is a Chinese skirmisher unit who uses an arquebus, or ancient musket, in battle. It has bonuses against heavy infantry and light cavalry units. The Arquebusier is part of the Territorial, Imperial and Black Flag Banner Armies, and can be trained at the Chinese War Academy and the Castle.</string>
    <string _locid="140049">The arquebus was a European matchlock gun that was adopted by Asian cultures in the sixteenth century. When Portuguese explorer, Fenrao Mendes Pinto, accidentallly landed on the small island of Tanegashima in the Japanese archipelago in 1543, he introduced members of the Shimazu clan to the arquebus, and altered Japanese warfare forever. Within ten years, Portuguese guns could be found on every battlefield in Japan.\n \nDespite the advantages of requiring smaller ammunition, and having a jarring psychological effect on its targets, the arquebus had many disadvantages. It was slow to reload, leaving its user at the mercy of archers firing at a much faster rate. It was also horribly inaccurate. Training to use the weapon was required, but this took time. However, once the training was complete, the arquebus proved to be a frighteningly lethal weapon, especially once the rate of reload was shortened by the development of volley-fire tactics.\n \nJapanese Sohei Archer warrior monks were the first to use controlled volley-fire in battle, unleashing 3,000 arquebusiers on the body of Oda Nobunaga’s army before the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. With the strength of their new weapon, the monks were able to repel the daimyo’s forces and hold the castle. It was such a stunning display that by 1592, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea, the arquebusier was the primary weapon used by Japanese soldiers in the attacking army.\n \nThe Chinese began to use the arquebus at about the same time as the Japanese, although it is not as well recorded. It is generally believed that early Chinese firearms were based on designs taken from the weapons used by Japanese wokou pirates, who in turn had copied the designs of the Portuguese. Once the gun was introduced to the Chinese it became a standard issue. In 1558, Chinese gunsmiths manufactured a total of 10,000 guns for the Chinese Imperial Army.</string>
    <string _locid="140050">The Ashigaru is a Japanese musketeer that is more expensive than a normal musketeer but causes slightly more damage and has more hitpoints. The Ashigaru can be trained at the Barracks. </string>
    <string _locid="140051">During the Heian Period (794-1185 CE), Japan’s system of a centralized military began to rapidly disintegrate with the rise of the warrior aristocracy. This left the creation and training of armies once again in the hands of powerful local lords. The ashigaru, which means “light-foot” or lightly armored, filled a growing need for enlisted warriors. They were the lowest class of warriors, commoners who were paid a stipend to enlarge a lord’s local army. Because they essentially fought as contractors, the ashigaru often had to provide their own provisions and were not always as reliable as their commanders would have liked.\n \nHowever, the status of the ashigaru evolved dramatically in the fifteenth century, following the introduction of European firearms to Japanese warfare. The arquebus required very little training to operate properly, unlike the use of a bow, which was considered an art form. By equipping his many ashigaru with guns, a local daimyo could complement his samurai warriors with a constant and brutal ranged attack. Thus, the ashigaru quickly became indispensable.\n \nThe most famous ashigaru to rise to prominence was Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the warrior turned powerful daimyo that spent the final years of the sixteenth century seeking to unite the disparate feudal warlords of Japan.</string>
    <string _locid="140052">The Changdao is a Chinese swordsman unit that wields a long, straight blade. While strong against cavalry and buildings, it is weak against ranged infantry. The Changdao is part of the Territorial Banner Army and can be trained at the Chinese War Academy. </string>
    <string _locid="140053">The Chinese long sword known as changdao was actually a modification of a Japanese design carried by wokou pirates of the sixteenth century. The famed Chinese pirate fighter, General Qi Jiguang, is said to have taken the existing Japanese odachi sword, lengthened it, and straightened its curve. The resulting blade was extremely long, over three feet, and ideal for repelling cavalry. Therefore, it replaced the traditional Chinese horse fighting blade, the zhanmadao. During his campaign to secure the Mongol border in 1560, Qi Jiguang’s Chinese forces used the new weapon to great effect. A proven success, the changdao was utilized throughout the remaining years of the Ming Dynasty.</string>
    <string _locid="140054">The Chu Ko Nu is a cheap and relatively weak Chinese archer unit that fires three times faster than regular archer units. As a result of its great speed, the Chu Ko Nu’s individual arrows do less damage than other arrows. However, the unit does have a bonus when fighting heavy infantry and light cavalry. The Chu Ko Nu is part of the Old Han and Standard Banner Armies can be trained at the Chinese War Academy.</string>
    <string _locid="140055">The Chinese chu ko nu repeating crossbow was known for its simple design and incredible rate of fire. It held a magazine of 10 bolts with steel tips, which it shot in succession, and was operated by grasping the stock in the left hand and working the lever with the right. In that swift movement, a bolt would drop into place, the string would be strung, and then the bolt would be fired, with another bolt dropping in to take its place. The weapon was specifically designed to fire rapidly and be turned on groups of enemy troops at a distance of no more than 150-250 feet. It was especially effective against cavalry. Horses provided large targets for the generally inaccurate chu ko nu, and when the animal was wounded it usually lost control and sowed pandemonium in the surrounding ranks.\n \nStories of the chu ko nu date back to 250 BCE, when legend has it that the first Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang used the weapon to shoot sharks for sport. Most accounts, however, have the creation of the chu ko nu occurring during the Chinese Han Dynasty, around the year 200 CE. </string>
    <string _locid="140056">The Gurkha is an Indian long-range skirmisher unit. It is very expensive but worth it, as it is very powerful. The Gurkha can be trained at the Barracks.</string>
    <string _locid="140057">The Gurkhas are a Nepalese ethnic group who originally claimed to be descendents of the northern India Rajputs, but who took their famous name from the small state of Gurkha in Nepal, which they conquered in the early sixteenth century. For 200 years, the Gurkhas expanded eastward, seeking to conquer all of Nepal. They succeeded, and by the mid-eighteenth century, the entire country was theirs and Hinduism was named the state religion. The Gurkhas attempted to invade Tibet but ultimately failed, and as war with the British broke out in India, they found their control waning. They did, however, discover a surprisingly fruitful partnership with the British occupational forces in India.\n \nKnown for their short, curved sword called a kukri, the Gurkhas served in the armies of India and Great Britain, where more than 200,000 soldiers fought alongside the British in World War I, and in forty battalions in World War II.</string>
    <string _locid="140058">The Qiang Pikeman is a Chinese infantry unit that uses a pike called a qiang in battle. It does more melee and siege damage than a regular Pikeman unit, but has fewer hitpoints. Like most pikeman units, the Qiang Pikeman is extremely effective against cavalry. The Qiang Pikeman is part of the Old Han Banner Army and Ming Banner Army, and can be trained at the Chinese War Academy.</string>
    <string _locid="140059">The qiang spear is often called the “King of Weapons” because of its ubiquitous role as one of the longest used and most reliable Chinese weapons. Its flexible wax wood shaft varied from 7 feet long (for infantry) to nearly 13 feet (for cavalry). The qiang spear was popularized during the Shang Dynasty (seventeenth century-eleventh century BCE) and was used up until the end of the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911 CE). In that time, it changed very little.\n \nThe qiang spear featured a leaf-shaped blade atop a horse-hair tassel. When a spearman made a slashing motion, the tassel created a blur effect that kept the enemy from being able to effectively target and seize the weapon from its wielder. The hair tassel is said to have also served a secondary purpose, to stop the blood on the blade from flowing down onto the wooden shaft, which would leave the wood slippery or sticky and thus make it more difficult to handle.</string>
    <string _locid="140060">The Rajput is a heavy Indian infantry unit that is extremely effective at countering cavalry. It wields a pair of pata blades in battle. The Rajput can be trained at the Barracks.</string>
    <string _locid="140061">The Rajput was a primarily Hindu warrior caste located in the northwestern region of India once known as Rajputana, now Rajasthan. Taking great pride in their ancestry and its emphasis on military virtues, the Rajput grew in power until 1616, when all the major clans had no choice but to submit to the might of Akbar and his Mughal Empire.\n \nThe Rajput warriors were known for using the unique and deadly pata, a sword-like weapon where the blade and the gauntlet were integrated into a single piece that was held by the wielder. Earlier iterations of the pata were said to have started at 10 inches in length, with later variations reaching a length of nearly 44 inches. This sturdy blade was effective at repelling armored cavalry, but could also be used in assaults against infantrymen, swung and slashed like a traditional sword. Supposedly, Emperor Akbar himself used the pata in battle, most notably during the siege of Gujarat in 1576.</string>
    <string _locid="140062">The Samurai is a Japanese swordsman that makes up the core of the Japanese army. A tough infantry unit, the Samurai is fast, has many hitpoints, and causes heavy splash damage to all units in an area. It is also powerful against buildings, as if it were a siege unit. The Samurai can be trained at the Barracks.</string>
    <string _locid="140063">The samurai were members of the Japanese warrior aristocracy who embodied the bushido code; they rose to power during the rival clan wars of the twelfth century. This bushido belief system - “the way of the warrior” - emphasized an unwavering loyalty to a master, the act of self-sacrifice, and an indifference to pain. From the twelfth century to the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603, the samurai were the dominant social class in Japan, and many acted as knights in the service of the warring feudal lords.\n \nAfter Tokugawa Ieyasu was declared shogun and began to consolidate power, the samurai were encouraged to leave their posts as village defenders and take more bureaucratic government posts in castle towns, earning government stipends to abandon their warrior ways. This was done to reduce the threat of masterless samurai, or ronin, who had become a threat to Tokugawa’s dictatorship. However, the drastic culture shift did not sit well with many samurai, and former warriors eventually led the overthrow of the shogunate in 1867.</string>
    <string _locid="140064">The Sepoy is the Indian musketeer unit that can be trained from the Barracks in the Commerce Age. It is more expensive than the European Musketeer, but also has more hitpoints and attack. In melee the Sepoy strikes harder than most other Musketeers at the expensve of a smaller attack bonus against cavalry. Nevertheless the Sepoy is still a good choice for repelling cavalry attack in melee.</string>
    <string _locid="140065">By definition, the “sepoy” is an indigenous soldier serving in the armed forces of a European power. The most commonly known example is a native Indian fighting for the British occupational forces in India, starting in the sixteenth century. The rank of sepoy is the lowest enlisted rank in the British India army, similar to that of a private.\n \nSepoy soldiers were the driving force behind the 1857 uprising associated with the British East India Company, the commercial trade empire that had occupied and exploited the territories of India since as early as 1610. The mutiny erupted when a group of sepoys refused to use their new Lee-Enfield rifles. Loading the rifles required the soldiers to bite off the ends of greased cartridges, and rumors that the cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs had circulated through the ranks. This outraged both Hindus, who regard cows as sacred, and Muslims, who regard pigs as unclean. After years of British mistreatment and disrespect, the sepoys found they had endured enough.</string>
    <string _locid="140066">The Shinobi is a Japanese stealth unit with strong ranged and siege attacks. The Shinobi can be trained at the Consulate using the Japanese Isolation feature.</string>
    <string _locid="140067">Translated to mean “one skilled in the art of stealth,” shinobi were masters of the art of stealth, also known as ninjutsu. They were peasants of no social rank, but in possession of expert skills that were sought after by generals and feudal lords, and that often fetched high prices. Most shinobi acted as assassins or spies, gathering reconnaissance information that could turn the tide of battle. While most feudal daimyo and honorable samurai waged a moral war against the outlaw shinobi, it is believed that many of these high ranking warriors actually were shinobi, and simply kept up the ruse of hunting the outlaws in order to deflect suspicion from their own actions.\n \nPopular culture has grossly misrepresented the appearance of shinobi, and they are most often identified by a black suit that supposedly helped them blend into the darkness. However, shinobi most likely dressed in the typical peasant garb of fifteenth-century Japan: remnants of samurai armor, with perhaps the addition of a head covering, and a special piece of footwear called jika-tabi, which had a split-toe design that improved gripping and wall climbing and were virtually silent. The shinobi arsenal consisted of a variety of weapons and diversions, many of which utilized gunpowder. Smoke bombs, firecrackers, hand cannons, and even land mines were used to stun enemies, or to provide a moment of confusion that allowed the shinobi to escape. These gunpowder secrets were carefully guarded within the shinobi clan. Another form of trickery were the ashiaro, wooden pads that were carved to look like an animal's paw, or a child's foot, and could be worn to produce misleading footprints.\n \nThe numbers of shinobi reached its peak in the centuries of war before the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate and the beginning of the Edo Period in 1603. During the waning years of the shinobi and the samurai, writers recorded the techniques and weapons of these arts in technical manuals in order to keep the traditions alive. The most famous of these was the “Mansen Shukai", written in 1676 by ninjitsu master, Fujibayashi Samuji. </string>
    <string _locid="140068">The Sohei is a Japanese warrior Monk unit that is similar to other Pikemen units. Thanks to their naginata  pole weapon, the Sohei are especially strong against cavalry units. The Sohei can be trained at the Zen Temple, a Native Trade Site. They can also be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140069">The sohei were an order of Japanese warrior monks living between the tenth and sixteenth centuries, a period when several militant religious sects held sway over local lords, challenging even the samurai warrior class for dominance.\n \nThe Japanese word “sohei” is roughly translated into English as monk (“so”) and warrior (“hei”). The sohei fought in large, extended, but not always officially ordained, brotherhoods that were geographically spread throughout smaller temples, all of which fell under the influence of a home temple’s monastic order. These central institutions, most notably those in Nara, and on Mount Hiei outside of Kyoto, held huge private armies of warrior monks. These armies often became embroiled in feudal clan rivalries, as many daimyo and samurai looked to ally with the sohei because of their technologically advanced weaponry and skills in battle. In addition, the sohei had a special form of spiritual weaponry, the kind only available to warriors of a religious order. They could intimidate their enemies by denouncing them at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara, which was considered a fate worse than death. They also used prayer beads to deliver curses on those who opposed them.\n \nIn battle, the sohei wore a form of light cuirass armor beneath a traditional kimono. They were known for fighting with the naginata blade, although they expertly wielded a variety of weapons, including the katana, the bow, and the arquebus.</string>
    <string _locid="140070">The Urumi is an Indian heavy infantry unit. Swinging its coiled sword, the Urumi is highly effective against heavy infantry and does a great amount of splash damage. The Urumi can be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140071">Practitioners of the Indian martial art of Kalarippayattu, which dates back to at least the twelfth century, begin their education at the age of seven. Once training commences, it progresses through four unique stages of development: Meithari, Kolthari, Ankathari and Verumkai. Meithari is a rigorous series of posture and coordination exercises that helps the student achieve peak physical condition through jumps, balance, and flexibility. Kolthari is the study of fighting with wooden weapons. Ankathari is the study of metal weapons, and near the end of this stage a student chooses a weapon in which to specialize. Finally, once the student has mastered all forms of weaponry, he is taught how to defend himself in hand-to-hand combat using grapples, blows, and strikes to vital pressure points, or marmam. Only the most trusted students of Kalarippayattu are instructed in this honored art.\n \nMasters of Kalarippayattu are highly skilled in many weapons, but none as strange, or as deadly, as the urumi, or flexible sword. The urumi is a flexible band of steel about one inch in width, and up to 5 feet in length, that is attached to a handle. Most urumi have multiple bands attached to a single handle. Because of its flexibility, an urumi can be coiled around the waist and inconspicuously carried like a belt. If a fight breaks out, the urumi can be uncoiled and swung like a sword. It is most effective when the wielder faces multiple enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="140072">The Yamabushi is a native Japanese heavy infantry unit that can be trained at the Consulate using the Japanese Isolation feature. Swinging its heavy, spiked club, the Yamabushi is effective as a pikeman, causing great damage against enemy infantry and buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="140073">Unlike the sohei warrior monks of the same period, the yamabushi were an order of loosely banded mountain hermits who had retreated to the mountains of Japan in pursuit of peace and worldly abstinence. The yamabushi were disciples of Shugendo, the study of man’s relationship to nature, and strived for spiritual enlightenment through the purging of outside influence. Over time, the yamabushi became the caretakers of all forms of obscure occult knowledge and were often sought after as healers and guides. In addition to their study of nature, esoteric imagery, and religious texts, the yamabushi also trained in the martial arts.\n \nBy the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the scattered yamabushi began to show an interest in affairs outside their mountain havens, and began to form loose groups known as konsha, which took orders from a central temple. Banded together in this way, the yamabushi, like their warrior monk brethren, the sohei, suddenly held political power in a region where clans and kingdoms were constantly toppled. These warrior monks fought alongside samurai in many campaigns of the Sengoku Period, until they were eventually crushed by the powerful daimyo Oda Nobunaga.</string>
    <string _locid="140074">The Yumi is a Japanese archer unit. It is an overall improvement on other archer units, as its range, damage, and hitpoints are all higher. It is especially effective at long range, but weak against cavalry. The Yumi can be trained at the Barracks. </string>
    <string _locid="140075">The word “yumi” means either a long or short bow used in kyudo, the ancient Japanese art of archery. The traditional yumi stands at over 6 feet fall, often dwarfing the archer, and is made from laminated bamboo, wood, and animal hide, in a process that is still the same today as it was two thousand years ago. The yumi’s unique asymmetric design, where the upper and lower curves differ, is a style that dates to around 250 BCE. It is believed the asymmetric shape was designed for use on horseback, so the bow could be switched from one side of the horse to the other with relative ease. </string>

    <string _locid="140077">The word “catamaran” comes from the Anglicized Tamil words “kattu,” or “to tie,” and “maram,” meaning wood, or tree. Comprised of two connected hulls or a single hull with two parallel keels, the catamaran is a watercraft that was developed by natives of Polynesia and first used in the fifth century CE. Its maneuverability proved advantageous for crews braving the waves of the Pacific Ocean, as it could reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour while maintaining its stability.\n \nWesterners adopted the catamaran design in the 1870s, when famous American naval engineer Nathanael Herreshoff began building a modified version of the craft. Today, catamarans can range from 12 to 315 feet, depending on their purpose, and are widely used for sport and business.</string>
    <string _locid="140078">The Chakram Thrower is an Indian unit that throws a razor-sharp hoop. In many ways it is considered an archer, striking enemy units from afar, but with an added splash bonus and increased hand attack. The Chakram Thrower can be trained at the Udasi Monastery. They can also be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140079">According to Sanskrit sources, the word “chakra” means circle or wheel. It is linked to the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs of chakra, which relate to centers of energy within the human body. The chakram, named for its resemblance to a wheel, is a circular metal weapon that ranges from 5 to 7 inches in diameter and is of varying thickness. In most cases, it has a sharpened outer edge, and a smooth inner edge by which it is handled. The chakram was usually thrown at its target from a range of 100 to150 feet, although it was also used as a close-combat melee weapon, spun and swung by hand. Soldiers could carry many chakram at one time, often hanging them along the length of their arms or even from a modified turban.\n \nFrom the sixteenth century on, the chakram was a weapon employed exclusively by Sikh soldiers, who threw them in large volleys like archers fire arrows. Following the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, also known as the First Indian War of Independence, the English dismantled most Indian armories, and many antique weapons, including chakram, were destroyed and sold as scrap. The twentieth century brought reports of Sikh still using the weapon in battle, with as much skill and accuracy as when it was at its peak. </string>

Mounted and armed with a rifle, the Conquistador is faster, but has less range and hitpoints than other cavalry. It is very effective against heavy cavalry, Coyote Men, and artillery units.</string>
    <string _locid="140081">Conquistadors were Spanish adventurers of the early sixteenth century who explored and conquered much of Central and South America for the Spanish Empire. Their journeys were not created or funded by the empire, but rather individual expeditions funded by merchants, and often with the primary goals of exploring, looting, and spreading Christianity to the indigenous peoples.\n \nWhile many of the most famous conquistadors sought treasures located only in legend, such as the Seven Cities of Gold or the Fountain of Youth, others claimed important firsts for European explorers of the era. Vasco Nunez de Balboa and his men crossed Central America and were the first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean.\n \nFifty years of exploration and exploitation in the Americas increased the wealth and expanded the territory of the Spanish Empire, but at much cost to the Native populations. In 1521, Hernan Cortes captured Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, and in the 1530s, Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire in Peru. Even with the destruction of these great civilizations, Native resistance to the foreign invaders continued for many years.</string>

    <string _locid="140083">The thuggee was a cult of Indian robbers and murderers operating primarily between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The members were called “thugs,” the root of the English word with the same meaning. Traveling in bands of twenty to one hundred men, they befriended wealthy travelers, waited for the right opportunity to strike, and then killed one or more victims before looting the corpses.\n \nThe thuggee were considered a cult because while their members were both Hindu and Muslim, they took the Hindu goddess of Khali as their patron and committed murders as acts of worship. It is said that the thuggee used a yellow scarf, or Rumaal (a symbol of Kali), to strangle their victims.\n \nMost groups of thuggee were eradicated during the British occupation of India in the nineteenth century, yet the cult remains mysterious to this day. It is said to have been responsible for many deaths, the estimated number ranging from 50,000 to 2,000,000 people.</string>

The word “dacoit” is an anglicized version of the Hindi word “dakaethee,” meaning a local robber or thief.\n \nSince the fourteenth century, dacoits held a position of prominence in rural Indian life. The most powerful became local warlords, holding great influence over local officials and politicians. They made money through ransoms and robberies, and by protecting members of their own castes against wandering bandits and rival dacoit. As payment, the villagers often sheltered the dacoit from the law.  </string>

    <string _locid="140087">Before exploding into greater conflict, the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, also known as the First War of Indian Independence, consisted of series of smaller bouts of violence manifesting the Indian people’s discontent with the British occupation and the prominent role of the British East India Company in daily life. The most common of these incidents involved arson. Several months before the rebellion ignited and united the country against the foreign occupation, a number of serious fires broke out in the areas surrounding the city of Calcutta. The arson of January 24, 1857 is often considered to be the turning point between scattered uprisings and the formation of a definitive resistance movement.</string>
    <string _locid="140088">The Iron Troop is a Chinese mercenary Unit that has a bonus against heavy infantry and light cavalry. It has less range then a crossbowman and most other archers, but makes up for it with powerful armor. The Iron Troops is good against other ranged units at range or in melee combat. The Iron Troop can be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140089">The Iron Troops were the brainchild of Koxinga, the Ming military leader and man responsible for ousting the Dutch from Formosa, now Taiwan, in 1662. Recalling memories of heavily armored Japanese soldiers from his youth, Koxinga brought the idea of iron-armored infantry units to his generals. They balked at the suggestion, claiming that with its weight of 50 pounds or more, iron armor was incredibly restricting. But one general, Gam Hui, had the brilliant idea of having their soldiers train specifically to carry such a weight and learn to fight while bearing it. He suggested that men train with sand bags attached to each foot, and those who wanted to be selected for the elite guard, known as iron man, would have to move a 400-pound stone around the training field three times in a single day. Only the toughest warriors would earn the right to fight as iron troops. With this training regimen in place, Koxinga began to build his army of iron troops, which reached a size of 10,000 men.\n \nAt first sight, the iron troops sowed confusion in their enemies. Other armies feared them and often hesitated to attack. The iron troops wore metal masks, armor, and often painted their faces to frighten and discombobulate the opposing soldiers. Members of the Chinese Qin army even wondered if the iron troops were gods, and if they should attack them at all. During Koxinga’s battles for Formosa, the Dutch soldiers quickly developed a deep fear of the iron troops. Diaries of Dutch soldiers include sketches, as well as passages such as this one: “All of his troops, besides their arms and feet, were covered in iron scaled armor. Even though many of them died, the others wouldn’t even look and charged on like crazy dogs.”</string>
    <string _locid="140090">The Jat Lancer is a mercenary Indian cavalry unit. It is faster than a typical heavy cavalry unit, and does devastating damage against enemy archers and skirmishers. It has superb survivability against ranged units, but has a tougher time surviving against melee units. For this reason, units like the Pikemen can defeat the Jat Lancer more easily than most cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="140091">The Jat people are a large ethnic group living in the Punjab, Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan states of India. They share no single faith, language, or series of customs, but are linked by a common history. Jats reached Egypt with Muslim conquerors, lived in Afghanistan before the Muslims, invaded China with the Mongol army, and even posed a threat to Tamarlane in Persia and Uzbekistan. The first mention of the Jat people in Indian literature occurred in 900 BCE in the Sanskrit epic, "Mahabharata". They are referred to as a democratic federation, or a collection of tribes.\n \nDuring the occupation of India by British forces, the Jats were designated a martial race, or an ethnic group that based on exhibited qualities was predisposed to fighting. The British recruited native soldiers heavily from these particular populations. Among the most distinguished were the 14th Murray’s Jat Lancers. Cavalry officer Badlu Singh was awarded the Victoria Cross for assaulting a machine gun placement during a World War I assault in Palestine.  </string>

    <string _locid="140099">The samurai were members of the Japanese warrior aristocracy who embodied the bushido code, and rose to power during the rival clan wars of the twelfth century. This bushido belief system - “the way of the warrior” - emphasized an unwavering loyalty to a master, the act of self-sacrifice, and an indifference to pain. From the twelfth century to the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603, the samurai were the dominant social class in Japan, and many acted as knights in the service of the warring feudal lords.\n \nA “ronin” was a masterless samurai warrior, and literally meant “drifting person.” A samurai became masterless when his master was defeated, or after the samurai lost his master's favor. Since a ronin did not serve any lord, he ceased being a true samurai, as the word “samurai” has its roots in “saburau,” Japanese for “to serve.” Becoming a ronin was incredibly undesirable. In fact, a samurai that lost his master was expected to commit seppuku or ritual suicide to retain his honor.</string>

The term “junk” has many origins, including roots in the Portuguese “junco,” the French “junque,” the Dutch “jonk,” the Malay “jon,” and the Javanese “djong.” The junk is identified by its high stern, projecting bow, and square linen sails. The sails are spread and contracted in an action similar to that of collapsible Venetian blinds. Instead of a keel, the junk has a large rudder. Junks were integral in Chinese trade and exploration up until the nineteenth century. </string>

During the Chinese battles of Formosa in the seventeenth century, Ming military leader Koxinga expected every member of his army, from the generals to the foot soldiers, to be versed in the methods of the rattan shield.\n \nRattan shields were widely used for a variety of reasons. Palms blanketed the regions of Taiwan and Hokkien, China, making rattan readily available. The shields were extremely light but uncommonly strong, able to block incoming projectiles, including bullets. They were even so buoyant as to be used by soldiers as flotation devices when crossing shallow bodies of water.</string>

Lacking a ranged attack, it is most effective as a melee unit, moving quickly around the battlefield and charging opponents to cause increased splash damage. The War Elephant can be trained at the Bhakti Temple. They can also be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140111">Often considered the natural predecessor of the modern-day tank, the elephant brought many unique elements to its role as a battlefield unit. Early successes had more to do with surprise and intimidation than battlefield effectiveness. Enemy horses or camels, whether frightened by the beast’s smell, or overwhelmed by its sheer size, proved powerless against the elephant. It trampled oncoming waves of infantry and knocked riders from their mounts, scattering ranks and causing general confusion. It had a similar effect on the human enemy, terrifying many men to the point of panic.</string>
    <string _locid="140112">The Wokou Ronin is a mercenary swordsman unit that can be trained at Saloons and Monasteries, and from certain ships. A wandering samurai with a true mastery of his blade, the Wokou Ronin is especially strong against cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="140113">A “ronin” was a masterless samurai warrior, and literally meant “drifting person.” A samurai became masterless when his master was defeated, or after the samurai lost his master's favor. Since a ronin did not serve any lord, he ceased being a true samurai, as the word “samurai” came has its roots in “saburau,” Japanese for “to serve.” Becoming a ronin was incredibly undesirable. In fact, a samurai that lost his master was expected to commit seppuku or ritual suicide to retain his honor.\n \nThe term "wokou" is a combination of the Chinese word “wo,” referring to Japanese, and "kou,” meaning bandit or invasion.\n \nBeginning in the thirteenth century, no group of sailors was as feared or as mighty as the plundering wokou pirates, 		and smugglers who terrified the Chinese and Korean coasts. The first attacks occurred in 1223, triggering immediate calls for the Kamakura shogunate of Japan to corral these scoundrels and prevent further attacks on the Korean coast. In 1227, as a show of strength, the shogun had ninety suspected wokou pirates decapitated before the visiting Korean envoy.\n \nDuring the Mongol invasions of the mid-thirteenth century, wokou attacks fell in number, most likely due to a heightened military preparedness on the part of both the Japanese and Korean governments. But this did not last. In the late fourteenth century, as central authority in Japan weakened, the wokou took full advantage, even branching out to initiate attacks along the coast of China. They profited highly from a severe trade embargo forced on Japan by the Qin and then Ming Dynasties of China, reaping rewards as black markets flourished. The wokou experienced periods of rise and decline, even attacking China with a makeshift fleet in 1419, but they ultimately became obsolete.\n \nAt its peak, the wokou culture was enough to threaten even the most powerful Asian rulers, and to appeal to the most ordinary of citizenry. Many men left behind their lives to seek fortunes at sea. Chinese merchants, militiamen, smugglers, Korean pirates, Portuguese sailors, traders, and even missionaries joined up with the notorious wokou pirates. </string>
    <string _locid="140114">The Wokou Junk is a naval unit that is like a Caravel, in that it can attack enemy units, transport friendly troops, and fish during peacetime. It can be built at the Saloon or the Monastery. You can often acquire Wokou Junks that arrive already full of units.</string>
    <string _locid="140115">The oldest references to the Chinese sailing vessel known as the “junk” date back to the Han Dynasty (220 BCE-200 CE), although it is generally believed that the junk was in use even earlier. The term “junk” has many origins, including roots in the Portuguese “junco,” the French “junque,” the Dutch “jonk,” the Malay “jon,” and the Javanese “djong.” The junk is identified by its high stern, projecting bow, and square linen sails. The sails are spread and contracted in an action similar to that of collapsible Venetian blinds. Instead of a keel, the junk has a large rudder.

They can be sent from the Home City, Holy Sites, or Tribal Council after they are unlocked. They are the only Home City Shipments that cost Coin.\n\nAsian civilizations can train repentant mercenaries from the Monastery, while European civilizations can train mercenaries from the Saloon. Different units are available on different maps. Look for Ninjas on the Great Plains or Mamelukes in Araucania. Mercenaries are a good choice to send or train if you have the Coin to spare, especially if your enemy is using them.</string>

    <string _locid="140120">The Chakram is a native Indian unit that throws a razor-sharp hoop. In many ways it is considered an archer, striking enemy units from afar, but with an added splash bonus and increased hand attack. The Chakram can be trained at the Udasi Monastery.</string>
    <string _locid="140121">According to Sanskrit sources, the word “chakra” means circle or wheel. It is linked to the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs of chakra, which relate to centers of energy within the human body. The chakram, named for its resemblance to a wheel, is a circular metal weapon that ranges from 5 to 7 inches in diameter and is of varying thickness. In most cases, it has a sharpened outer edge, and a smooth inner edge by which it is handled. The chakram was usually thrown at its target from a range of 100 to150 feet, although it was also used as a close-combat melee weapon, spun and swung by hand. Soldiers could carry many chakram at one time, often hanging them along the length of their arms or even from a modified turban.\n \nFrom the sixteenth century forward, the chakram was a weapon employed exclusively by Sikh soldiers, who threw them in large volleys like archers fire arrows. Following the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, also known as the First Indian War of Independence, the English dismantled most Indian armories, and many antique weapons, including chakram, were destroyed and sold as scrap. The twentieth century brought reports of Sikh still using the weapon in battle, with as much skill and accuracy as when it was at its peak. </string>
    <string _locid="140122">The Shaolin Rattan Shield is a Native swordsman unit. Its strength lies in its speed. However, this comes at a cost, as it does little melee or siege damage. The Rattan Shield can be trained at the Shaolin Monastery. They can also be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140123">The practice of rattan shield fighting is an art form consisting of six distinct fighting methods that is still practiced in parts of Taiwan. During the Chinese battles of Formosa in the seventeenth century, Ming military leader Koxinga expected every member of his army, from the generals to the foot soldiers, to be versed in the methods of the rattan shield.\n \nRattan shields were widely used for a variety of reasons. Palms blanketed the regions of Taiwan and Hokkien, China, making rattan readily available. The shields were extremely light but uncommonly strong, able to block incoming projectiles, including bullets. They were even so buoyant as to be used by soldiers as flotation devices when crossing shallow bodies of water.</string>
    <string _locid="140124">The Sohei is a native Japanese unit that is similar to pikemen units. Thanks to their naginata pole weapon, the Sohei are especially strong against cavalry units. The Sohei can be trained at the Zen Temple, a Native Trade Site. They can also be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140125">The sohei were an order of Japanese warrior monks living between the tenth and sixteenth centuries, a period when several militant religious sects held sway over local lords, challenging even the samurai warrior class for dominance.\n \nThe Japanese word “Sohei” is roughly translated into English as monk (“so”) and warrior (“hei”). The sohei fought in large, extended, but not always officially ordained, brotherhoods that were geographically spread throughout smaller temples, all of which fell under the influence of a home temple’s monastic order. These central institutions, most notably those in Nara, and on Mount Hiei outside of Kyoto, held huge private armies of warrior monks. These armies often became embroiled in feudal clan rivalries, as many daimyo and samurai looked to ally with the sohei because of their technologically advanced weaponry and skills in battle. In addition, the sohei had a special form of spiritual weaponry, the kind only available to warriors of a religious order. They could intimidate their enemies by denouncing them at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara, which was considered a fate worse than death. They also used prayer beads to deliver curses on those who opposed them.\n \nIn battle, the sohei wore a form of light cuirass armor beneath a traditional kimono. They were known for fighting with the naginata blade, although they expertly wielded a variety of weapons, including the katana, the bow, and the arquebus.</string>
    <string _locid="140126">The Tiger Claw is a Native hand infantry unit that attacks with its animal-like claws in close-quarters melee combat. It has a bonus against infantry and does great damage. The Tiger Claw can be trained at the Bhakti Temple. They can also be shipped from your Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140127">The tiger claw, or “bagh nakh,” is a weapon named for the wound it inflicts: a series of slice marks that resemble the clawing left by a wild animal. Usually made of metal, the tiger claw was wielded by Indian assassins and warriors of the seventeenth century. The basic design consists of a metal handle that is grasped in the palm. Two to four curved claws sprout from handle, sticking from the gap between the fighter’s fingers. More of a close-quarters, brawling weapon, the tiger claw is believed to have also been used in larger battles, most famously by Sivaji, the powerful emperor of the Indian Maratha. </string>

    <string _locid="140130">The Atakebune is a Japanese naval unit can be built at a Dock. It has a high number of hitpoints and can train units like a Barracks.</string>
    <string _locid="140131">The atakebune-class naval ship was used during Japan’s warring states period of the sixteenth century, when rival daimyo built fleets to occasionally engage in naval warfare. When Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the country’s disparate clans under his leadership, he also gained control of many feudal armies. The invasion of Korea in 1591 saw the redeployment of many weapons Toyotomi had acquired many resources from his former enemies, including the atakabune-class ships. They proved vital in the his military campaigns in the region.\n \nThe atakebune was a boxy, armored ship by design, its hull held together with iron nails that were highly susceptible to rusting. As a result, the atakebune was not suited for carrying heavier payloads, like cannons. The preferred method of Japanese naval combat consisted of grappling an enemy vessel and then boarding with an assault party, so the lack of cannons was not a hindrance.</string>
    <string _locid="140132">The Catamaran is a small Indian naval unit that can be built from the Dock if you have control of an Indian Holy Site. It has a weak attack but can be used to transport troops. Bandit Catamarans full of units can be shipped from the Home City.</string>
    <string _locid="140133">The word “catamaran” comes from the Anglicized Tamil words “kattu,” or to tie, and “maram,” meaning wood, or tree. Comprised of two connected hulls or a single hull with two parallel keels, the catamaran is a watercraft that was developed by natives of Polynesia and first used in the fifth century CE. Its maneuverability proved advantageous for crews braving the waves of the Pacific Ocean, as it could reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour while maintaining its stability.\n \nWesterners adopted the catamaran design in the 1870s, when famous American naval engineer Nathanael Herreshoff began building a modified version of the craft. Today, catamarans can range from 12 to 315 feet, depending on their purpose, and are widely used for sport and business.</string>

    <string _locid="140135">Virtually everything on a tall ship is flammable, from wooden planks and tar that seals seams to greased ropes and canvas sails, to gunpowder - especially gunpowder! Black powder ships, also called fireships, were ships set afire and allowed to drift (or were sometimes piloted by a minimal crew, who escaped before impact) into enemy fleets with the purpose of setting them afire and blowing them up. Fireships were particularly nasty when sailed into harbors to destroy immobile ships at anchor.\n \nFireships were used by the English Royal Navy against the larger and more powerful Spanish Armada. Unable to find a proper port or deep mooring, the Spanish fleet congregated in a defensive arc, into which the British sailed a half-dozen fireships, scattering and confusing the Spanish fleet. This allowed the smaller English fleet to engage the Spanish Armada on a more even footing.</string>
    <string _locid="140136">The Fuchuan is a Chinese naval unit, a heavy warship that can be built at the Dock starting in the Fortress Age. The Fuchuan can train troops like an Atakebune, but it is much more powerful.  </string>
    <string _locid="140137">The Fuchuan warships were a standard naval junk used by the Chinese during the treasure expeditions of the Ming Dynasty, starting at the beginning of the fifteenth century. These ships were about 165 feet long and had five masts flying the standard square-rigged sails of the junks. </string>
    <string _locid="140138">The Fune is a Japanese naval unit that can be built at the Dock starting in the Commerce Age. Like a Caravel, the Fune is primarily used to slowly gather Fish and Whales as resources, but it can also be used to transport troops from place to place.</string>
    <string _locid="140139">In 1281, when the Mongol Hordes of Kublai Khan invaded Japan, the Japanese had no navy with which to fight back. Most of the military action occurred on land, although groups of adventurous samurai utilized coastal fishing boats to assault, board, and then seize ships of the Mongol navy.</string>
    <string _locid="140140">The Ming Treasure Ships are stationary naval units that generate Crates of resources that can be gathered by Villagers. </string>
    <string _locid="140141">Between 1405 and 1424, the Ming Dynasty of China sent massive treasure fleets to expand their empire and establish trade and diplomatic relationships with known and unknown nations. Virtual cities, the treasure fleets were composed of a variety of different Chinese junks. Crews numbered in the tens of thousands, with experts of every discipline on hand to provide the leadership with whatever expertise or skill was desired, from astrologers to interpret the stars, to animal handlers to corral and care for exotic species acquired during the long voyages. Farmers manned special agriculture ships that worked like movable farms, cultivating crops to feed the many thousands of mouths. There was even a cadre of Imperial soldiers to escort the galaxy of ships wherever it sailed.\n \nThe treasure ships themselves were technological marvels that were far ahead of their time. Sailing with nine masts, these ships reached over 400 feet in length and 185 feet in width, and displaced approximately 3,100 tons of water, dwarfing any European vessels of the period. Watertight bulkheads contained drinking water, and could become storage compartments for housing sea animals. They also helped to keep the massive vessels afloat in the event the hulls were breached.</string>
    <string _locid="140142">The Tekkousen is the most powerful naval unit in the Japanese fleet. It has a large amount of hitpoints, a good range, and a big attack. The Tekkousen is good against buildings, pounding villages from the sea. However, it is vulnerable to other ships or land-based artillery.</string>
    <string _locid="140143">The Korean kobukson (“turtle ship”) is typically considered as the first armored boat, a precursor to the American ironclads of the eighteenth century. Likewise, the Japanese later used armored ships in their feudal wars of the sixteenth century, as rival daimyo battled each other for land and sea supremacy. Daimyo Oda Nobunaga constructed six tekkousen (“iron armor ships”) for his personal navy. These boats were protected by 3-inch armor plating, and armed with multiple cannons and high caliber rifles. They were utilized during the invasion of Korea in 1592-1598.</string>

They are considered to be of greater spiritual purity than members of other castes. The greater Brahmin caste is divided into ten sub-castes that are regionally based, with five in the north of India and five in the south.\n \nThe Brahmin community has its root in ancient India’s Vedic period, roughly from 1,500 to 600 BCE. Brahmins adhere to the acceptance of the Vedas, the oldest scriptural texts of Hinduism. They believe that the means or ways to salvation are diverse, and that God is one being, but takes countless names and forms. This single deity is the same across all cultures and languages, seeming to change to fit individual perceptions. Scholars, teachers, priests, intellectuals, scientists, and knowledge-seekers formed the Brahmin class.</string>

    <string _locid="140153">During his rule over the Mughal Empire of India, Akbar the Great brought the whole of his military organization under a new system of administration called the mansabdari. The title was taken from the term “mansab,” which means rank. Officers in the Mughal army were given a mansab and then expected to be servants of the state, with their dismissal or suspension resting directly in the hands of the emperor.\n \nThere were thirty-three grades of mansabdars, differentiated by the Zat and the Sawar. The Zat referred to the number of troops that the mansabdar maintained, while the Sawar referred to the number of horses that he maintained. The number of soldiers under a man’s command could start at ten and rise into the ten thousands. Of course, the highest rank that any common officer could hold only offered a command of 5,000 men. Larger forces were always first allotted to royal princes. Yet, after the death of Akbar at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the grades were increased. Common officers could reach the mansabdar grade corresponding to a command of over 20,000 men.</string>

    <string _locid="140155">The Mongol army of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was one of the most effective fight forces of all time, centering its battlefield strategy on the tenets of flexibility, mobility, and a powerful siege. Clad in light armor, horse archers rode and fought independently of cumbersome supply lines, collecting valuable reconnaissance information as they disrupted enemy positions and sowed seeds of panic. Their tactic of swift advances and false retreats often left the steppe riders out of harm’s way but within arrow range for their attack. As the warriors attacked, mounted couriers relayed messages across various fronts and within the combined army, which consisted of a variety of different units working together.\n \nWhen the Mongols prepared for a final siege, they brought engineers to the front. Siege engines and rockets were deployed to scatter enemy formations, and to isolate pockets of troops to keep supplies or reinforcements from reaching them.</string>

The wokou experienced periods of rise and decline, even attacking China with a makeshift fleet in 1419, but ultimately became obsolete, aided by the sword hunt.\n \nAt its peak, the wokou culture was enough to threaten even the most powerful Asian ruler, and to appeal to the most ordinary of citizenry. Many men left behind their lives to seek fortunes at sea. Chinese merchants, militiamen, and smugglers, Korean pirates, Portuguese sailors, traders, and even missionaries joined up with the notorious wokou pirates. </string>
    <string _locid="140160">The Villager is the main resource gatherer for all Asian civilizations. They are relatively inexpensive but fragile; they are not meant for combat, but throw spears to defend themselves and others. Villagers can be used to collect Treasures.Each civilization has a limit to the number of Villagers they can have at once. Villagers pay for themselves rather quickly; and the longer an individual Villager is alive, the greater the contribution to the overall wealth of a given colony. Some civilizations may receive Villagers from defeating guardians, while others have to rely solely on producing them from Town Centers.\n \nHighly industrious and loyal to a fault, the Villager lives to work for you. Whether it's chopping down the seventeen thousandth tree, scurrying across the map to a distant pile of silver ore, or endlessly toiling away at a mill, the Villager is ready to tackle any tedious task. The Villager’s hobbies include running away from enemy soldiers, being thrown into the river by enemy cannon fire, and screaming—a lot of screaming.</string>

    <string _locid="140162">The Brahmin is an Indian unit similar to an Explorer and War Chief. The Brahmin rides an elephant, and as such uses a damaging stomp attack when engaging enemy units. </string>
    <string _locid="140163">A Brahmin is a member of India’s highest priestly Hindu caste. They are the only caste that can perform Vedic sacrifice, interpret the Vedas, and preserve Vedic hymns. They are considered to be of greater spiritual purity than members of other castes. The greater Brahmin caste is divided into ten sub-castes that are regionally based, with five in the north of India and five in the south.\n \nThe Brahmin community has its root in ancient India’s Vedic period, roughly from 1,500 to 600 BCE. Brahmins adhere to the acceptance of the Vedas, the oldest scriptural texts of Hinduism. They believe that the means or ways to salvation are diverse, and that God is one being, but takes countless names and forms. This single deity is the same across all cultures and languages, seeming to change to fit individual perceptions. Scholars, teachers, priests, intellectuals, scientists, and knowledge-seekers formed the Brahmin class.</string>
    <string _locid="140164">The Sohei Archer is a Japanese unit similar to an Explorer and War Chief. The Sohei Archer uses a bow and arrow, and when his enemy falls below a certain amount of health, he’ll deal a Divine Strike blow, killing them outright. </string>
    <string _locid="140165">The sohei were an order of Japanese warrior monks living between the tenth and sixteenth centuries, a period when several militant religious sects held sway over local lords, challenging even the samurai warrior class for dominance.\n \nThe Japanese word “sohei” is roughly translated into English as monk (“so”) and warrior (“hei”). The sohei fought in large, extended, but not always officially ordained, brotherhoods that were geographically spread throughout smaller temples, all of which fell under the influence of a home temple’s monastic order. These central institutions, most notably those in Nara, and on Mount Hiei outside of Kyoto, held huge private armies of warrior monks. These armies often became embroiled in feudal clan rivalries, as many daimyo and samurai looked to ally with the sohei because of their technologically advanced weaponry and skills in battle. In addition, the sohei had a special form of spiritual weaponry, the kind only available to warriors of a religious order. They could intimidate their enemies by denouncing them at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara, which was considered a fate worse than death. They also used prayer beads to deliver curses on those who opposed them.\n \nIn battle, the sohei wore a form of light cuirass armor beneath a traditional kimono. They were known for fighting with the naginata blade, although they expertly wielded a variety of weapons, including the katana, the bow, and the arquebus.</string>
    <string _locid="140166">Various kinds of rickshaws can be used to construct buildings for the Asian civilizations, similar to how wagons work for the Europeans. They can very quickly create a variety of buildings for free, such as Docks, Cherry Orchards, Rice Paddies, Dojos, Mango Groves and Castles.</string>
    <string _locid="140167">Contrary to popular belief, rickshaws did not originate in the East and were not even glimpsed there until the mid-nineteenth century. The name itself, “rickshaw,” is not specifically linked to any specific conveyance, but rather to the idea behind it: Japanese “jinrikisha,” literally meaning a human-powered vehicle.\n \nThe rickshaw first appeared in Japan around 1868, during the Meiji period. Its speed and low cost of operation quickly made it the preferred form of transportation, and by 1872, the city of Tokyo was home to about 40,000 rickshaws. Soon after its introduction in Japan, the rickshaw appeared on the streets of India. It was primarily used by Chinese traders to ship goods; but in 1914, the Chinese applied for permission to use rickshaws as a method of human transport. Once that occurred, the rickshaw became a common sight in most major Asian cities. </string>

    <string _locid="140170">The Trade Rickshaw is similar to the Stagecoach in that it travels along a predetermined Trade Route and delivers experience points, Food, Wood, or Coin to any Trading Post it passes. At this level, the road is a packed, rutted track that can be improved one more time. The Trade Route appears as a white line on the Mini Map. Any player can build on an unclaimed Trading Post site. Enemy players can own Trading Posts along the same Trade Route. For Asian civilizations, the Trade Route is first traveled by a Rickshaw, which can then be upgraded to a faster and more effective Trade Cart.</string>

    <string _locid="140172">Available in the Commerce Age, the Caravanserai is similar to a Stable but instead of producing mounted equine units, it trains camels and elephants. It is unique to the Indian civilization.</string>
    <string _locid="140173">A caravanserai was a quadrangular building frequented by merchants along routes in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeastern Europe. It was designed specifically to accommodate the needs of travelers and their pack animals. The central courtyard featured a fountain and was opened to the sky. The caravanserai was surrounded by a series of arcades and stalls large enough to keep 300 to 400 camels comfortably. A typical caravanserai offered refreshment for humans and animals, space for religious worship, lodging, and a small market where those passing through could purchase new goods for the road ahead. Some of the more elaborate caravanserai even offered luxurious private baths.\n \nThe word “caravanserai” is derived from the Persian “karwan,” which signifies a company (or “caravan”) of travelers in a large inn or “serai.” Early Muslim rulers often built and maintained these inns on well-worn travel routes to encourage political solidarity, trade safety, and economic growth of their kingdoms.</string>
    <string _locid="140174">The Castle is a defensive building that is much stronger than a tower. It can train artillery units, and even act as a safe haven for villagers that need to be garrisoned out of harm’s way. The Castle is available in the Exploration Age, and can be shipped using selected Home City cards.</string>
    <string _locid="140175">The fortification of towns had been in practice since ancient times, exhibited in the high-walled cities of Rome and the palaces of Byzantium; but in the ninth century, the feudal lords of Europe began to experiment with the castle, or fortified residence. These began as an elevated patch of terrain surrounded by a primitive ditch. Throughout medieval times, as siege technology developed and the threat of war constantly loomed, European rulers began to raise the walls of their fortresses higher and higher, and thicker walls were topped with towers and parapets.\n \nBy the thirteenth century, castles had become highly sophisticated, and the integral spine to any kingdom. First, a strategic location was chosen, such as on a high cliff or at the bend in a river. Then a moat was dug, restricting access to a narrow point that was often blocked by a retractable drawbridge. The keep, or innermost part of the castle, was protected by a series of walls that had to be breached in order to enter, defeat the survivors, and claim victory.\n \nThe earliest Japanese castle was the yamashiro, a deforested hill carved into a series of walls and courtyards. Each of the horizontal baileys gave defenders an open view of the battlefield. Because it had the same primarily defensive purpose as the European castle, the yamashiro shared many of the same features, with its squat, angular walls surrounding ditches. Also, both structures housed barracks and training facilities for a standing army led by the elite warrior class (the samurai, in the case of the Japanese).</string>
    <string _locid="140176">The Cherry Orchard is a small, resource-rich building that is unique to the Japanese civilization. It is built from a rickshaw and provides Food that can be harvested by Villagers.</string>
    <string _locid="140177">Since ancient times, flowers have played a meaningful part in Japanese culture, embodied in the art of flower viewing, or Hanami. It is believed that the Japanese borrowed this enjoyment of nature from the Chinese during the Nara Period (710-784), in which the Tang Dynasty heavily influenced Japanese way of life. The first flowering object of affection was the ume blossom, or the Asian plum, but over time the practice of hanami has become almost synonymous with the enjoyment of sakura, or cherry blossoms.\n \nBeginning in the Imperial Courts of Japan, events were often celebrated with festivities beneath the falling blossoms of the cherry tree. Such festivals spread to the samurai class and eventually the common people, since blossoming coincided well with the beginning of school years, fiscal schedules, and the general spring season. Even today, the weather forecast from March to early May is closely watched as it can dictate the successful planting and growth of that year’s cherry blossoms.</string>
    <string _locid="140178">The Consulate is an important building available to Asian civilizations, allowing the Japanese, Chinese, and Indian players to establish relations with European nations. This provides a powerful civilization bonus. When a player builds up Export resource, it can be spent to purchase specialized European military units and improvements. Export is gained automatically by your Villagers. The more villagers you have working and the higher the Age of your civilization, the faster you gain Export.</string>
    <string _locid="140179">A consulate, also known as an embassy, or a diplomatic mission, is a group of people from one state or organization present in a foreign state to represent their state’s interests. A consulate is generally located in a busy tourist city, and takes care of minor diplomatic tasks such as issuing visas and diplomatic papers. The word “consulate” literally means “office of the consul,” who is a diplomat appointed to foster trade and take care of expatriates.</string>
    <string _locid="140180">The Dojo is a special Japanese building that can be shipped from the Japanese Home City in the Fortress Age. It spawns Japanese infantry or cavalry units in groups of three or five, or it can be configured to produce experience points. The player can only ever acquire two Dojos.</string>
    <string _locid="140181">In Japan, the dojo serves as much more than a training facility for martial artists. A dojo is any formal training facility where members learn and practice physical skills and art forms, specifically the “do” forms. The Japanese suffix “do” means the way of, and often implies that the technique in question possesses a spiritual element. Since the Meiji era (1868 to 1912), Japanese martial artists have adopted this suffix for the names of martial arts, such as Aikido, Judo, and Kendo.\n \nIn Japanese culture, the dojo is a symbolically important structure. Training is usually conducted outside the building on the grounds, while the interior is used for more ritualistic observations, and as a display for artifacts and weapons associated with the dojo and its members. The dojo is cared for and maintained by its students, who at the end of every each training session perform a ritual “souji,” or cleaning. The importance of rank pervades every aspect of dojo life; there are even separate entrances to the building, one for the teachers, and one for the students.</string>
    <string _locid="140182">The Rice Paddy is a building that can be constructed by all three Asian civilizations, and acts as a combination Mill and Estate. It allows a player to toggle between Food and Coin production. The Rice Paddy costs the same as a Mill but receives a bonus Estate function.</string>
    <string _locid="140183">The evolutionary origins of Rice, the genus oryza, are rooted in such distant history that no exact geographic location has been defined as the true source. A popular theory claims that the ancient supercontinent known as Gondwana, which included most of the landmasses in today’s southern hemisphere, was home to oryza; but when Gondwana split into pieces 200 million years ago, rice traveled with the newly created continents and landforms, populated the new continents and islands that became Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Madagascar.\n \n A rice paddy is an arable selection of land planted with rice seed that is flooded, providing the large amounts of water essential to rice growth. The paddy is irrigated by diverting water from rivers and mountain streams into a complex network of canals developed over years of use. Rice farmers often terrace the paddies up a hillside or slope, which conserves water by allowing it to flow down through successive rice fields. Rice seed is usually planted in a seedbed but transplanted to the paddy as a young plant. The water level begins at a depth of 6 inches, but as the plant grows, farmers gradually drain the water. By harvest time the water is almost entirely drained, and the farmers can collect the rice from the dried fields.\n \nFifty percent of the world’s rice is grown in paddies that are fed by natural rainfall; thirty-five percent comes from paddies flooded by both rainfall and irrigation. The major rice-producing countries - including China, India, and Vietnam - primarily cultivate paddy rice.</string>
    <string _locid="140184">The Monastery is a building available to all three Asian civilizations during the Exploration Age. It is used specifically to provide Asian Monks with special upgrades. Repentant mercenaries can also be trained here.</string>
    <string _locid="140185">“Monastery” derives from the Greek word “monasterion,” and describes a group of people, usually monks or nuns, who live a life apart from the rest of society because of their devotion to a religion and its ascetic principles. This community often shares the common goal of striving to reach spiritual perfection and wisdom, often taking vows of celibacy, poverty, and obedience.\n \nMonasteries were first built in the fourth century BCE to accommodate pilgrims during their annual retreat, or vassa, a period lasting from July to October. The vassa took place during Southeast Asia’s rainy season. The monks, who were typically a migratory group, were expected to remain in a single place out of the weather, and under intense meditation. Early retreats were held in pavilions and parks that had been donated by wealthy benefactors. These vihara, Sanskrit for “refuges,” became popular, and as time passed the custom of permanently residing in communal dwellings became more desirable.\n \nOne of the most famous Buddhist monasteries is the Shaolin Monastery, located in the Henan province of China, founded in 495 CE. The edifice is associated specifically with Chan Buddhism and the martial art of Kung Fu. Monastery legend states that the Indian monk Bodhidharma visited the temple in 527 CE. During his time meditating on the mountain overlooking the monastery, Bodhidharma taught himself a form of martial arts to defend against wild animals and bandits. He stayed at the temple for nine years, and before his departure he taught his disciples the skills he had learned, creating the martial arts legend that surrounds the Shaolin monks to this day.</string>
    <string _locid="140186">The Sacred Field is an Indian building that can be built instead of a Livestock Pen. A player can task livestock to the Sacred Field to increase the livestock's experience production. The Sacred Field can also be used to raise Sacred Cows.</string>
    <string _locid="140187">As a source of food and a symbol of life in Hinduism, the cow may not be killed.  According to the ancient religious text, the “Rigveda,” the cow is a goddess associated with Aditi, the mother of all gods. Therefore, slaughter is taboo. In ancient times, cows were sacrificed and their meat eaten, but never primarily for consumption, and milk-producing cows were never killed. Even during periods when meat-eating was permitted, vegetarianism was encouraged.\n \nOn a more practical level, slaughtering cows for beef was an extremely expensive act for sacrifice or as a gift, since the animal was a source of many important products: milk for consumption, fuel from dung, and browned butter for lamps. Later, in the early centuries CE, the cow became an appropriate gift to priests of the higher caste, or Brahmans. It was even said that killing a cow was equal to killing a Brahman. </string>
    <string _locid="140188">A Shrine can be built by the Japanese and is similar to a House, but is more expensive and has more hitpoints. It can be used to toggle between Food, Wood, or Coin, and when placed near certain animals that can be hunted or made livestock, it will attract and task up to four animals to produce extra resources of whatever variety Shrines are currently producing.</string>
    <string _locid="140189">A Japanese Shinto shrine and the surrounding natural area are called a jinja, and its sole purpose is for the enshrinement and worship of a kami, a god within a natural object, such as the trees or the sun. It is believed that jinja were originally constructed as temporary shrines for periodical festivals held at holy sites, such as on a mountain or near a cave. It was believed that kami migrated from place to place and could not be confined.\n \n A jinja has several parts. The honden is the building that contains the goshintai, which literally means, “the sacred body of the kami.” It is usually small and undecorated and only accessible to the Shinto devout. The torii gates serve as the scared entrance to the jinja space, and are perhaps the most recognizable feature.</string>
    <string _locid="140190">The Porcelain Tower is a great Chinese Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Porcelain Tower sends you a Shipment of Food. This Wonder can be toggled to produce either Food, Wood, Coin, or a mixture of all three along with experience points and Export.</string>
    <string _locid="140191">Located on the south bank of the Yangtze River in Nanjing, China, the Porcelain Tower was once considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The people of China called it Bao'ensi, or the "Temple of Gratitude,” but visiting Europeans called it the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing in reference to the tower's porcelain bricks. Rising from an octagonal base were nine stories that reached a final height of 260 feet. Although that height was impressive, what made the tower unforgettable were the brilliant white bricks that faced the tower. These bricks glittered in the sun by day and were illuminated by as many as 140 lamps by night. Colorful stoneware tiles with green, yellow, white, and brown glazes were worked into the porcelain panels to form the images of animals, landscapes, flowers, and bamboo.\n \nThe Porcelain Tower and other great temples were destroyed in the year 1900 by an invading Anglo-French force known as the Eight-Power Allied Forces. The tower is currently under reconstruction.</string>
    <string _locid="140192">The Temple of Heaven is a great Chinese Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Temple of Heaven sends you a Shipment of Villagers. This Wonder allows you to use the Transcendence ability, which heals every unit in your army.</string>
    <string _locid="140193">The Temple of Heaven was built in 1420 during the Ming Dynasty so Chinese emperors could offer a sacrifice to heaven on the winter solstice, thanking heaven for the previous year's bounty and to petition for favor in the coming year. The temple complex covers almost 3 million square meters and is enclosed within a long wall. Chinese emperors called themselves “The Son of Heaven” and dared not build their own dwelling (the Forbidden City) bigger than a temple dwelling for heaven. The northern portion of the temple complex is semicircular, symbolizing the heavens, and is higher than the southern part, which is square, symbolizing the earth.\n \nThe temple complex is an aggregation of many buildings, including The Circular Mound Altar (Yuanqiutan), the Imperial Vault of Heaven (Huangqiongyu) and the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest (Qiniandian), which contains twenty-eight huge posts; the four posts along the inner circle represent four seasons; the twelve posts along the middle circle represent the twelve months; and the twelve posts along the outer circle represent the twelve Shichen (Chinese "hours," each consisting of two Western hours). The roof is covered with black, yellow, and green colored glaze, representing the heavens, the earth, and everything on earth.\n \nSmaller structures include the Three Echo Stones and Echo Wall. A wide bridge called the Vermilion Steps Bridge (Danbiqiao, or "Sacred Way") connects almost all of the buildings. The Chinese believed that the emperor could go to heaven through this bridge; the Yu Route was reserved only for the emperor; the Wang Route on the other side was for princes and high officials.</string>
    <string _locid="140194">The Confucian Academy is a great Chinese Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Confucian Academy sends you a Shipment of Cho Ko Nu or Arquebusiers. This Wonder automatically generates the Flying Crow artillery unit over time, at no cost. </string>
    <string _locid="140195">Confucius (Kung Fu-Tzu, or "Master Kung"; birth name: Kung Chiu) was born in 551 BCE. During his life he attempted, but failed, to establish rationalism and meritocracy in Chinese government. However, his philosophy that social harmony could be achieved only if humans were free from deprivation, that all people possessed the same potential, and that education was the means to prevent people from straying from ethical behavior, took hold after his death. By 124 BCE, the Han Dynasty had established an Imperial Academy in which students could study the Confucian classics and, by passing a rigorous examination, enter the vast Chinese bureaucracy. The initial enrollment was fifty-five students. By 618 CE, during the Tang Dynasty, three Imperial academies had been established at Chang'an - the Kuo-tzu hsueh, T’ai hsueh (Great Academy), and the Ssu-men hsueh - which were followed by the creation of the Directorate of Education in about 628. In addition to these national centers of learning, there were also prefectural academies established throughout the country.</string>
    <string _locid="140196">The Summer Palace is a great Chinese Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Summer Palace sends you a Shipment of Steppe Riders or Iron Flails. This Wonder automatically generates Banner Armies units over time, at no cost. </string>
    <string _locid="140197">The Summer Palace is the archetypal Chinese garden, and is among the most noted and classical gardens of the world. The Old Summer Palace was constructed in the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) during the succeeding reigns of feudal emperors; by the time of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), it had “become a luxurious retreat providing royal families with rest and entertainment. Originally called “Qingyi Garden” (Garden of Clear Ripples), it was part of the famous “three hills and five gardens”: Longevity Hill, Jade Spring Mountain, Fragrant Hill, Garden of Clear Ripples, Garden of Everlasting Spring, Garden of Perfection and Brightness, Garden of Tranquility and Brightness, and Garden of Tranquility and Pleasure. An Anglo-French invasion force destroyed the garden during the second Opium War. In 1888 the Dowager Empress Cixi rebuilt the garden and renamed it the Summer Palace (Yiheyuan).\n \nCentered on the Tower of Buddhist Incense (Foxiangge) the Summer Palace consists of over 3,000 structures, including pavilions, towers, bridges, and corridors. Composed mainly of Longevity Hill and Kunming Lake, The Summer Palace occupies an area of 294 hectares (726.5 acres), three quarters of which is water. Guided by nature, artists designed the gardens so that visitors would see marvelous views and be amazed by perfect examples of refined craftwork and the finest materials.</string>
    <string _locid="140198">The White Pagoda is a great Chinese Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the White Pagoda sends you a Shipment of Disciples. This Wonder increases the attack damage and number of hitpoints of the Shaolin Master and Shaolin Disciples. It also increases the build limit on Shaolin Disciples.</string>
    <string _locid="140199">The White Pagoda, located on Qionghua (Jade Flower) Island in Beijing’s Beihai Park, is a stupa (dome-shaped Buddhist shrine) built in the early Qing Dynasty, in the eighth year of Shunzhi (1651).\n \nThe tower is an iconic attraction of the park and at 35.9 meters (117.7 feet) high, it was of one of the tallest buildings in China at the time when it was built. It was repaired three times due to severe damage, in 1679, 1730 and 1976.</string>

    <string _locid="140201">Near the gardens of the Taj Mahal stands the important sixteenth-century Mughal monument known as the Red Fort of Agra. This powerful fortress holds the imperial city of the Mughal rulers inside its 1.5-mile long red sandstone walls. It comprises many palaces, such as the Jahangir Palace and the Khas Mahal, built by Shah Jahan; audience halls, such as the Diwan-i-Khas; and two very beautiful mosques.</string>
    <string _locid="140202">The Taj Mahal is a great Indian Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Taj Mahal sends you a Shipment of crates of Wood. This Wonder allows you to use the Cease Fire ability, which stops all fighting for a brief period of time. </string>
    <string _locid="140203">The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum located in Agra, India. The Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned it as a monument and tomb for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, after she died in childbirth. The most visually identifiable feature of the tomb, the massive tear-shaped marble dome that caps the structure, is evocative of the grief the emperor felt over the loss of his beloved.\n \nThe epitome of Mughal architecture, the Taj Mahal incorporates elements of many Asian cultures. The tomb combines the domed pavilions and eaves of Indian architecture, with the precise gardens and impressive waterworks of Persia. The towering minarets, found at the four corners of the structure, and the ornamental stonework exhibit Islamic motifs. Across the reflecting pool, the grounds contain a number of other smaller tombs, as well as a mosque.\n \nThe Taj Mahal’s construction spanning nearly twenty years, the Taj Mahal is adorned with priceless stone, metal, and gems, from all over India and Asia. Its cost was enormous. Soon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan’s son Aurangzeb imprisoned him. When Shah Jahan's died, he was buried in the Taj Mahal next to his wife, the only asymmetrical element in the tomb's otherwise perfect symmetry. Despite incidents of defacement and subsequent restorations during the British colonial period, the Taj Mahal remains a resilient monument to love.</string>
    <string _locid="140204">The Charminar Gate is a great Indian Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Charminar Gate sends you a Shipment of Sepoys. This Wonder allows you to train Mansabdars. Mansabdars are special versions of normal units with twice the hitpoints, and they also enhance the attack and hitpoints of nearby units of the same type. </string>
    <string _locid="140205">Located in the City of Hyderabad, a former capital city of India, the Charminar Gate was built in 1591 at the center of the city to commemorate the eradication of a plague. At the place where Emperor Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah prayed for an end to the plague, he vowed to erect a mosque if his prayer were granted. When the plague ended, he built the mosque. The structure became known as Charminar because of its four characteristic minarets (“char,” meaning four, and “minar,” meaning spires). Each minaret has four stories, each of which opens into a plaza. Four is a number of significance in Islam. In this case, each of the four pillars represents a different aspect of knowledge.\n \nWhen India became a British colony, the gate served as a storage facility for liquor and opium. The domes at the top of the gate offer unobstructed views of the city - a city once offered up in hopeful prayer by a distraught emperor.</string>
    <string _locid="140206">The Karni Mata is a great Indian Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Karni Mata sends you a Shipment of experience points. This Wonder substantially increases the gather rate of your Villagers.</string>
    <string _locid="140207">In Hinduism, Karni Mata is an incarnation of Durga, the fourteenth-century warrior-deity often called “the rat goddess.” In the small town of Deshnoke, in the Indian state of Rajasthan, stands a marble temple dedicated to Karni Mata. Built in the nineteenth century, the Karni Mata temple is known less for its architecture than its title of “Temple of Rats,” due to its 200,000-plus rodent inhabitants.\n \nThe legend tells that at one point in the life of Karni Mata a child of one of her clansmen died. In an attempt to bring the child back to life, Karni Mata approached Yama, the god of death. Yama explained that the child had already been reincarnated. Defeated, Karni Mata made an agreement with Yama: from that day forward, all of her clansmen would be reborn as rats until they could be born back into the clan.\n \nSince Hinduism views death as but one step in a person’s quest for oneness with the universe, the rats of Karni Mata are treated like royalty.

    <string _locid="140211">The renowned Great Buddha, or “daibutsu,” is a giant bronze statue of the enlightened Amida Buddha located in Kamakura of the Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan. The statue itself is hollow and sits on the former site of the Kotokuin temple that once housed it. Sculpted by Tanji-Hisatomo and One-Goroemon and weighing 125 tons, it is commonly held that the statue was constructed in 1252 at the behest of the priest Joko.\n \nWith a height of nearly 45 feet, it is the second largest Buddha in Japan. The statue took more than a dozen years to complete after its first wooden iteration in 1243. A unique element of the Great Buddha’s history is that its construction was funded entirely by donations from faithful devotees and received no assistance from any governments or official sources.\n \nThe Great Buddha of Kamakura is an iconic reference of the influence of Buddhist faith on Japanese culture, and is a celebrated landmark of Japan from the era of the Kamakura shogunate.</string>

Once built, the Golden Pavilion sends you Shipments of Yumi Archers each time you Age up. This Wonder gives a bonus to your military and provides advanced Arsenal improvements. </string>
    <string _locid="140213">The Golden Pavilion Temple (Kinkaku-ji) is the name of the hall of relics at the temple grounds of Rokuon-ji. Aside from the basement floor, the whole pavilion is covered in pure gold leaf. Situated in Kinkakuji-chô, Kita-ku, near the Japanese city of Kyoto, The Golden Pavilion Temple was originally constructed in 1397 to serve as the retirement villa of the third Ashikaga Shogun, Yoshimitsu. Originally a luxurious estate owned by the Saionji clan, Yoshimitsu acquired the land after the clan’s influence declined.\n \nThe pavilion itself houses relics of the Buddha and serves as the centerpiece of the temple. The temple itself has been burned down multiple times during its rich and storied history, particularly during the Onin War (1467-1477). The temple burned down again later by an insane monk, which later became the subject of a film entitled "The Temple of the Golden Pavilion".\n \nRokuon-ji, the temple proper, features more than the glinting structure of Kinkaku-ji. Lush gardens and a mirror pond accentuate the Zen quality of the location.</string>

    <string _locid="140218">The Torii Gates is a great Japanese Wonder that you can build to advance to a later Age. Once built, the Torii Gates gives you a Shipment of a Castle Rickshaw and a Samurai. This Wonder increases the experience points that you receive for each kill, every unit and building completed, and your base experience points trickle.</string>
    <string _locid="140219">The Torii is a gateway arch that signifies the passage from profane to sacred (unclean to clean). When combined with washing one's hands and mouth with water, passing underneath a torii on the way to visit a shrine is an act of sanctification and purification. People that are in an unclean state are not permitted to approach a Shinto shrine as their uncleanliness would defile the grounds. Some shrines can have multiple torii, but there is usually a "first torii" (ichi no torii) that is larger than the others and stands at the entrance to signify entry into the shrine region. Most often associated with Shinto shrines, torii can also be found at some Buddhist temples.\n \nA torii is formed from two upright posts topped by a horizontal kasagi (cap beam) that extends beyond the uprights on either side; beneath the kasagi is a nuki (horizontal tie beam) which is mortised through the uprights and links them together. There can be some stylistic variations, depending on the overall style of the shrine, as long as it follows the basic form.\n \nThe true origin of the torii is unknown. There are many theories, but no single one has gained general acceptance. The word “torii” literally means “where the birds reside.” Since birds act as messengers between the spirits and humans in Japanese mythology, it seems appropriate that they should "be" at the boundary between the sacred world of the shrine and the profane world outside.</string>
    <string _locid="140220">With a rich coastal region and a bountiful interior, the island of Borneo promises endless opportunities for expansion and conflict. Each team has access to a Trade Route servicing the breadth of the island, where a wealth of Gold and Food may be discovered by those willing to brave the dense jungle. The waters around the island are visible at the start of the game, and are ripe for fishing.</string>
    <string _locid="140221">Surrounded by the South China Sea, the Sulu and Celebes seas, the Makassar Strait, and the Java Sea, Borneo is the largest island in the Malay Archipelago, and the third largest island in the world. Much of its 290,000 square miles are covered with dense rainforests that drain into rivers such as the Rejang and Kapuas, which are important sources of trade and local commerce. With the exception of the rivers, only navigable in small craft, the terrain is almost impassable. The highest point of Borneo is the peak of Mount Kinabalu, reaching a height of 13,455 feet. A host of diverse animals makes their homes in the island’s hot and humid environment, including elephant, deer, orangutan, gibbon, crocodile, Malay bear, and a wide variety of snakes.\n \nThe first written reference to Borneo can be found in "Ptolemy’s Geography" (150 CE), even though the discovery of Roman trade beads suggests that an earlier foreign influence may have once existed. The sixteenth century brought worldwide interest in the island for trade purposes, especially from European nations eager to expand their empires. The Portuguese arrived first in 1521, followed by the Spanish, Dutch, and English, all of which established trade boundaries and protectorates.</string>
    <string _locid="140222">Players begin on a humble patch of rock rising up from the middle of the sea. Fortunes will be sought on the central island, as players must migrate north to establish bases on this resource rich coast. Wild beasts roam the island's northern region, while Gold mines and ancient Treasures can be found nestled amongst the cliffs to the south.</string>
    <string _locid="140223">The island of Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, is located in the Indian Ocean off the southern tip of India. While technically an island, the nation is nearly linked to the subcontinent by a chain of partially submerged limestone shoals that are not crossable and act as an obstacle for seagoing navigators. One hundred forty miles at its widest point, and 270 miles long, Sri Lanka can be divided into three geographic zones corresponding to elevation: the highlands, the lowland plains, and the coastal belt. The central highlands include numerous valleys and plateaus. The highest point, the mountain of Pidurutalagala, tops 8,000 feet. In contrast, the elevation of the surrounding plains ranges from 300 feet to sea level. Finally, the coastal belt rises only about 100 feet above sea level, populated by lagoons, sandy dunes, beaches, and marshes. In the northeast and southwest, the coast is lined with rocky cliffs. Sri Lanka is famous for its gemstones, including topaz, sapphires, and rubies.\n \nThe first migrations from the Indian subcontinent to the island began in 500 BCE with the Sinhalese people from the north of India, and Tamil-speaking Dravidian peoples from the south. In 377 BCE the Sinhalese established their capital in the city of Anuradhapura, and in 250 BCE the Sinhalese king converted to Buddhism during a missionary visit by the son of the Indian emperor. Anuradhapura flourished under this Buddhist influence, and quickly became one of the world’s most prominent centers of world religion. As time passed, Sinhalese power drifted south as the Tamil kingdom of India claimed the north portion of the island. However, the balance of power was irrevocably altered in 1505 when the Portuguese invaded, the first in a wave of European imperialism. Distraught over the powerful foreign influence, the Sinhalese allied with the Dutch to oust the Portuguese and install the Dutch East India Company as the ruling power. This did not last long. In 1796 the Dutch relinquished control of the island to the British, and in 1802 it became the colony of Ceylon, property of the British crown.</string>
    <string _locid="140224">Players start on opposite sides of a central plateau that contains thick forests and abundant wildlife. Resources are plentiful, as mines, small herds, and sparse forests ring the surrounding lowlands.

The plateau is not present in free-for-all games.</string>
    <string _locid="140225">The Deccan, also called The Great Country, is the central portion of the Indian peninsula south of the Narmada River. Bordered by the Western and Eastern Ghats mountain ranges, the Deccan encompasses eight states and a range of ecosystems. The name “Deccan” is an anglicized form of the Prakit word “dakkhin,” derived from the Sanskrit “daksina,” meaning “south.” The Deccan is a plateau with an average elevation of 2,000 feet. Its central rivers - the Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri - flow east from the Western Ghats Mountains and empty into to the Bay of Bengal. Despite its rocky appearance, the underlying soil is volcanic and therefore extremely rich, ideal for the production of cotton and other crops. The height of the Western Ghats Mountains prevents regular rainfall, resulting in arid scrub forests in the west; the moist highlands to the east contain deciduous forests, home to wolves, sloth bears, gaurs, and Asian elephants.\n \nLargely untouched by early Aryan invasions of the second century BCE, the Deccan was ruled by Mauryan and Gupta dynasties for centuries until it became an independent Muslim nation in 1347. It was later split into five sultanates. Although the Mughals largely conquered the Deccan in the seventeenth century, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb exhausted his resources and military power in his attempts to absorb the region. In the following years the region fell under the power of the Maratha confederacy. Much later, the plateau hosted a rivalry between France and Britain until the British won control of the Deccan, which they eventually relinquished in the Indian independence of 1947.</string>
    <string _locid="140226">Gain control of vital choke points on the map to restrict your enemies' access to the most valuable resources. Players start with Town Centers in close proximity to thick forests. Beyond the trees, in the lush central valley, vast quantities of Food and Gold lie ripe for the taking. A Trade Route runs through this mountainous region, but beware, as established native settlements also dot the landscape.</string>
    <string _locid="140227">The Himalayas form the greatest mountain system on Earth, with more than 110 peaks rising above 24,000 feet, including Mount Everest. The range extends more than 1,600 serpentine miles from the Indus River in Pakistan to Tibet, covering more than 230,000 square miles. The flora of the Himalayans varies depending on both altitude and climatic conditions, ranging from deciduous forests in the foothills to more coniferous forests higher up. Even higher, alpine forests fill the landscape, giving way to high-altitude meadows. Scrublands lead up to the permanent snowline of the mountains. Animals such as leopards, rhinoceroses, and varieties of deer once inhabited the forests of the sub-Himalayan foothills, but deforestation has destroyed much of this natural refuge.\n \nForty million people live in the Himalayas. There are a combination of Indian Hindus in the sub- and middle-Himalayan valleys located in the eastern region of Kashmir to Nepal, and Tibetan Buddhists who inhabit the high Himalayas in the north. Outside influence has been minimal; but since 1950, tourism has grown into a thriving business for local economies. One million people visit the Himalayas annually for mountain activities. Most treks are conducted the same way they have been for thousands of years, with a porter and a pack animal.</string>
    <string _locid="140228">Players begin on either end of a long narrow island. Mines can be found on the smaller islands nearby. A larger landmass opposite the other coast features a tiny but pivotal Trade Route. The limited supply of Food on the main island will drive players to fish the rich coastal waters.</string>
    <string _locid="140229">Often referred to as the Japanese mainland or central Japan, Honshu is the largest of the four Japanese islands. It is 800 miles long and 150 miles wide. Honshu is a mountainous, volcanic region, with Mount Fuji, its highest point, soaring to an impressive peak of 12,389 feet. The mainland is separated from the island of Hokkaido by the Tsugaru Strait, from Kyushu by the Shimonoseki Strait, and from Shikoku by the Inland Sea. The climate of Honshu ranges geographically from snowy winters in the north to warm, subtropical temperatures in the south. While the products of agriculture are rich and varied - rice, cotton, fruits, and vegetables - Honshu is the source of two of Japan’s most famous resources: silk and tea. Its remote, heavily forested areas are teeming with monkeys, deer, boars, antelope, salamanders, snakes, and birds.\n \nIn 1543, Portuguese sailors were the first Europeans to make contact with Japan, opening a limited trade relationship between the East and West. In 1549, St. Francis Xavier introduced Christianity to the island. After the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the acting warrior dictator of Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu claimed the title of shogun. His family would go on to rule Japan for 250 years. Domestic stability reigned during this period, but social progress was curtailed by a powerful central autocracy. Christianity was suppressed and commerce with foreign countries was prohibited. Only the Dutch retained the right to communicate with the Japanese from their single trading post on the island of Nagasaki.</string>

    <string _locid="140231">Before it became a country, Mongolia was known foremost as a region of Asia defined by its central region, the Gobi Desert, and the surrounding steppe landscape. The borders of the Mongolian steppe touches provinces of China on the west and east, Siberia on the north, and the Great Wall of China on the south. It may represent the greatest expanse of largely unchanged grassland in the world, supporting wolves, corsac foxes, great bustards, steppe eagles, saker falcons, Mongolian gazelles, and several rare species of crane. In one of the world's last massive migrations, Mongolian gazelles cross this landscape by the millions.\n \nThe history of Mongolia is punctuated with empires built by warlords who swept from the steppe on horseback into southern China, conquering the countryside. The greatest of these was Genghis Khan, who in 1205 united the Mongol tribes into one of the greatest empires the world has ever seen.	</string>

Since the map portrays a randomly selected part of the passage, three terrain variations are possible, each with unique characteristics. Players do not need to establish the route, only capture it before the enemy does!</string>
    <string _locid="140233">The Silk Road was a 4,000-mile caravan route beginning in Chang’an, China, and stretching west along the Great Wall of China, over the Pamir Mountains, across Afghanistan, and ending at the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Used as early as 1000 BCE, the Silk Road was the most important pre-modern trade route in human history, providing merchants access to an extensive cultural and commercial network spanning China, central Asia, and Europe. Taking its name from early shipments of Chinese cloth, the road enabled a constant flow of goods, jade, gold, silver, wool, and spices from west to east, and inland to the sea.\n \nThe Silk Road came about not from a desire for extensive trade, but when Chinese Emperor Wudi of the Han Dynasty sent a court representative to central Asia to seek allies in his campaign against warring Mongolian nomads who had besieged his empire. Unfortunately, the very Mongolian nomads he was hoping to subdue captured the court representative and imprisoned him for ten years. Upon his escape, he continued to central Asia to pursue his original goal, but success eluded him. Despite this, his journey west made the people of central Asia and the Chinese aware of each other. Soon the inhabitants of central Asia sought goods from China, and vice versa. Over its 1,500 years of use, the Silk Road route reached its heyday in the thirteenth century, when the Mongol conquests encouraged trade and travel between East and West. European artisans, ambassadors, missionaries, and merchants, including Marco Polo, ventured eastward as far as China, fostering the demand for Asian goods in the West. However, this interest in foreign trade ultimately led to the route’s decline. In the fifteenth century, European leaders began seeking a way to get from Europe to Asia by sea, and the discovery of South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope route rendered the Silk Road obsolete.</string>
    <string _locid="140234">During the dry season, the waters of the Yellow River recede to create fertile new islands, and animals often gather near the river's edge to drink. During times of flood, extra resources abound and naval craft are sometimes seen along the river. Recruit local groups as allies to take advantage of their multiple Trade Routes located along the borders of the map.</string>
    <string _locid="140235">The Yellow River, the second largest river in China, originates with a collection of springs and lakes in the Kunlun Mountains, and then travels southeast, reaching a length of 3,395 miles. It gets its name from the yellow silt that colors the waters between Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, a product of loamy soil deposits. Years of silt buildup in the Yellow River has led to devastating floods, which is the impetus for one of the river’s less desirable nicknames: China’s Sorrow. The environment contains diverse habitats. The deciduous forests are comprised of oaks, elms, and pistachios, with conifers and cypress growing in the higher regions. The wetlands serve as resting places for many migratory birds en route to their destinations. Today, overuse of the river has reduced its waters to near-crisis levels, but the Chinese government has taken steps to divert waters from other sources - including China’s largest river, the Yangtze - to replenish the shrinking supply.</string>

(female)\nDiet: Large and small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, domesticated animals\n \nThe black panther is one of the largest and most agile of the big cats, and boasts the greatest geographic range. It is found in Africa south of the Sahara, as well as in parts of North Africa, the Middle East, India, Asia, and Indonesia. The panther also lived in Europe until around 11,000 years ago, up to the end of the last ice age.\n \nThe body of a black panther is a perfect combination of the speed and grace of the smaller cats coupled with the strength and endurance of the big cats. A solitary, nocturnal creature, the black panther hunts by sneaking up on its prey and then striking with a powerful bite.\n \nUp until the twentieth century, many believed that the black panther and the leopard were two separate species, but they aren’t – the black panther is actually a leopard. Nevertheless, most people still refer to black leopards as “black panthers.”</string>

Size: 3.5 tons (Indian); 7 tons (African)\nDiet: Grasses, leaves, twigs, bark, shoots, fruit, flowers, roots, tubers, bulbs\n \nFamous for its muscular snout and regal curved tusks, the elephant is the world’s largest land animal. Because of its immense appetite, an elephant will often stay close to areas with abundant supplies of water and vegetation, although herds migrate seasonally to find fresh resources.\n \nEven with a long natural lifespan of sixty years or more, the elephant has faced a number of challenges to its survival. During the last 40 million years, the number of elephant species on earth has dropped from more than 600 to only three: the savannah and forest elephants of Africa, and the Asian elephant. This is due to climate fluctuations and the resulting vegetation changes, as well as the negative impact of humanity.\n \nMature elephants have no natural enemies except the human being. During the twentieth century, the elephant population fell from an estimated 5-10 million to nearly 400,000.</string>

For example, the “walking catfish” of Southeast Asia can use a slithering motion to move across land in search of deeper waters. It can temporarily breathe out of water because of a modified gill arch that forms a chamber for air. Another catfish - the electric catfish - found in the Nile River, can discharge electrical shocks.</string>

Its gritty skin is coated with a layer of mucus and can change color patterns, often shining with a slight opalescent sheen. Spreading from its large, head-like body, are two sweeping fins that guide its movement through the water. The mola mola is found in all tropical and temperate oceans.\n \nThe word “mola” comes from Latin and means “millstone” - in reference to these fishes’ roundish shape. The term “sun fish” comes from its habit of floating atop the water as if sunbathing. </string>

Size: varies by species, from 6 lb. to 1,800 lb.\nDiet: Small fish, squid, crustaceans\n \nThe genus Thunnus, or tuna, consists of several species of schooling ocean fish that have long been found in waters across the world. The tuna is most commonly known as a food fish.\n \nThe tuna has a sleek, streamlined body that tapers to a narrow junction at the tail. It is built for sustained speed, with strong pectoral fins that fold into grooves against the body, and eyes that lie flush with the body surface. At full speed, the tuna has been recorded reaching speeds of up to 46 mph. A wide, forked tail propels it through the water. On each side of the tail base are bony keels that are extensions of the caudal vertebrae. A special vascular system below the skin helps keep the fish’s body temperature higher than that of the water in which it’s swimming, increasing its output of the muscles and accelerating nerve impulses. This allows the tuna to exist in colder regions.\n \nTuna is most sought after as a food fish. Its flesh is pink to dark red, different from the white flesh of most fish. This is due to the tuna’s muscle tissue and its greater quantities of the oxygen-binding molecule myoglobin. </string>

Size: 12-16 ft., up to 7,000 lb.\nDiet: Fish, rays, other sharks\n \nWith up to 3,000 teeth at any one time, the great white shark is a ferocious sea predator that lives in the waters near North America, Hawaii, South America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, West Africa, Scandinavia, Japan, and the eastern coastline of China and southern Russia. The great white moves through the water with ease thanks to its streamlined torpedo-shaped body, pointed snout, and crescent-shaped tail. When it reaches the surface, the shark’s dorsal fin and the tip of the tail are visible jutting from the water.\n \nThe great white shark has an incredible sense of smell. In fact, its nose is used only for smelling since it breathes using gills. Its nostrils can smell one drop of blood in 25 gallons of water. Jelly-filled canals in its head called the ampullae of Lorenzini allow the shark to sense minute electrical discharges in the water. The shark can then sense the small electrical fields generated by nearby animals, and hunt. </string>

(female)\n Diet: Unknown\n \nThe giant squid is one of nature’s most mysterious and misunderstood beasts. With related folklore dating back to the sixteenth century, most knowledge of this creature has been rooted in myth. This is due to the fact that no one had ever seen a giant squid alive in its natural habitat until September 2005, when footage of the squid was captured on video by Japanese researchers. Up until then, the giant squid’s realm, the dark waters located 3,300 feet below the ocean’s surface, revealed few clues. Even today, most information about the world’s largest invertebrate comes from dead specimens that have washed ashore or been mistakenly caught in fishing nets.\n \nThe giant squid is a cephalopod, a member of the mollusk class identified by its bilateral symmetry. It is a speedy carnivore, capturing prey with long tentacles covered with suction cups and ringed at the base with teeth, and then finishing with a bite from its sharp beak. A squid moves by a form of natural jet propulsion, squirting water from its mantle through its siphon, which then shoots it through the water. Although the relationship has been highly dramatized by humans, the only known natural enemy of the giant squid is the sperm whale.</string>

The salamander is fully aquatic, and since it lacks gills, it depends on respiration through the skin, which is porous and wrinkly. The coloring of the salamander is usually blotchy with patches of brown, green, or black. Unlike the Japanese giant salamander, the Chinese species has a pointier snout and a long tail, but the two have the elongated body and four short legs in common. The Chinese giant salamander has tiny eyes with no eyelids. Due to its poor eyesight, the salamander uses nodes on the top of its head to detect changes in the water and locate its prey.</string>

Size: 4-5.5 ft. long, 2-3.5 ft. to shoulder, 100-250 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, leaves, shoots of bushes\n \nThe Siberian ibex roams the rocky cliffs of Siberia’s Sayan Mountains and other Asian mountains, pawing at the snow to reach the vegetation underneath, and fleeing to high outcroppings when threatened. They generally live at high altitudes but can climb to heights of 16,000 feet during the summer months, descending to areas where the snow has difficulty covering.\n \nThe basic color of the Siberian ibex is light tan, which darkens to black during the winter months. Both sexes have a small beard beneath their chins and horns, but the horns of the female are shorter and curve slightly backwards, while the horns of the male grow into great, looping arcs.  </string>

Size: 6-10 ft. long, 150-300 lb.\nDiet: Carrion, small mammals, reptiles and their eggs, birds, insects\n \n 	With a size dwarfed only by its enormous appetite, the Komodo Dragon is the world’s largest living lizard, inhabiting the Indonesian island of Komodo, and neighboring islands of the Lesser Sunda archipelago. It is a product of island gigantism, meaning it has grown to its immense proportions as a result of a lack of carnivores in its environment; its size makes the Komodo an apex predator - a predator that is not prey to any other animal in its ecosystem. The Komodo is one of the monitor lizards, among the oldest living lizards on Earth, descendents of the mosasaur, a marine lizard that lived roughly 136 million to 65 million years ago and reached lengths of up to 33 feet.\n \nThe male Komodo Dragon is bigger than the female. Its skin color ranges from dark grey to a brick red, while a female features more of an olive green coloring, with patches of yellow dotting the throat. A Komodo Dragon’s tail is often as long as its body, and the lizard is able to stand up on its hind legs if it needs to catch prey that is out of reach. Using it its peculiar tongue, the Komodo detects both taste and smell, and can locate a dying animal from up to 6 miles away. This sense also proves advantageous when the lizard is moving through the dark.\n \n  An eating machine, the Komodo Dragon feeds by tearing large chunks out of its prey, holding the body down with its forelegs and ripping into the flesh with its serrated teeth, which can often grow to one inch or longer. It has a loosely articulated jaw, flexible skull, and expandable stomach to make it easier to swallow large meals. The Komodo Dragon doesn’t need to worry about choking on its food, since a small tube under the tongue connects to the lungs, allowing the lizard to eat and breathe simultaneously.\n \nRecently there has been debate over whether or not the Komodo’s distinctive red saliva contains venom that weakens or even kill’s the lizard’s prey. Fifteen strains of virulent bacteria have already been isolated in the lizard’s saliva. This bacterium is known to cause sepsis of the bloodstream and weaken prey, causing dysfunction of the circulatory system.</string>

Size: 9 ft. long, 3 ft. to shoulder, 400 lb.\nDiet: Antelope, zebra, wildebeest, other large herbivores, domestic livestock, carrion\n \n  Few creatures are as unmistakable as the lion, a legend of the natural world since ancient times, and one of few animals worthy of the title “king of the beasts.” With its impressive mane and imposing size, the lion has long been glorified as the epitome of the big cat, even though it shares most physical characteristics with its cousin, the tiger, which is actually a larger animal. The lion has a powerful compact body, with strong forelegs and jaws used specifically for seizing an escaping animal and killing it. Adult lions have the notable golden coat of hair, which is a sign of its maturity, since cubs have light spots that fade and vanish over time. The pronounced mane is only present in males, and even then it usually grows only on lions in cooler climates.\n \nThe lion is the most social of the big cats, living in groups called prides that are comprised of up to forty individuals. The females do most of the hunting while the males defend the community. At an early age, a male lion is driven from the pride and eventually joins together with brothers or cousins in small coalitions to search for a new group. Once he enters a new pride, a male lion will go about systematically killing any cub that cannot outrun him.\n \nIn the past, lions lived and hunted in many diverse geographic regions, from the vast corridor linking Europe and India, known as Eurasia, to across the breadth of Africa. However, by the second century, populations in the Middle East and Europe had been hunted to extinction. Today, lions now live only in Africa, with the exception of a small population clinging to life in the Gir Forest of northwestern India.</string>

They live in small sholas, or patches of evergreen forest, at elevations ranging between 2,000 and 3,500 feet.\n \nThe lion-tailed macaque gets its name from the tuft of hair tipping its long, droopy tail. It is coated with smooth black hair that allows it to move undetected through the shadowy treetops. Its face is framed with a large gray mane that often gives the monkey’s head an enlarged appearance.\n \nLion-tailed macaques travel in groups of ten to twenty, picking up food as they go and storing it in their cheeks. Later, they rub the backs of their hands against their cheeks to extract the stored food.</string>

Size: 20-24 in. to shoulder\nDiet: Grasses, flowers, shoots, mosses, lichens\n \nThe musk deer is a shy, solitary deer with a speckled coat, big ears, a short tail, and no antlers. It is the only deer that possesses a gall bladder, and the male’s downward curving canine teeth are unique to the deer family. The musk deer can be found in the mountainous regions stretching from Siberia across Korea to the Himalayas, at heights of up to 8,000 feet.\n \nThe male’s musk gland, or “pod,” located between its abdomen and its genitals, is much sought after due to its intense, yet pleasant, odor, attributed to the organic compound muscone. The smell can only be extracted once the musk gland is removed, dried, and the resultant paste significantly diluted. It is often used in perfume, and as such is the most expensive animal product in the world. Thus, poaching is primarily responsible for the reduction in existing musk deer populations. However, the acquisition of muscone from musk deer is now controlled, and other sources have since been discovered, such as from musk flower, musk wood, and the musk seed. Most often it is created synthetically.</string>

A white stripe runs along the underside of both sexes, and patches of white spot the face, ears, and a white bib, or “beard,” below the throat. Odd in shape, the nilgai has four thin legs supporting a rather robust body and powerful neck and shoulders. Short, conical horns top the head of a male, reaching lengths of 8-10 inches.</string>

In the evenings when the orangutan does settle, it builds a new nest every night by bending the fronds of the betel tree. While not as well built as a gorilla, the orangutan is in fact larger in size. It has a body covered in long, striking red hair. Puffy cheeks and a hanging throat pouch full of air sacs that allows the orangutan to produce a unique bubbling call that can be heard over distances close to a mile. </string>

(females)\nDiet: Fish, seabirds, sea turtles, aquatic mammals\n \nThe orca is the largest member of the dolphin family Delphinidae, of the mammalian order Cetacea. It is often referred to as the killer whale because of its ferocious appetite; it is instantly recognizable thanks to its unique, bold black-and-white coloring. The orca inhabits more parts of the world than any other aquatic mammal, including every ocean, but most commonly in colder waters.\n \nIt is no surprise that indigenous peoples around the world revere the orca as a fearsome guardian of the sea, for at first glance it is a terrifying beast, with its huge glossy black body, round, blunt head and strong jaws lined with forty to fifty spiky teeth that are designed for tearing and ripping rather than chewing. They are also one of the fastest animals swimming in the seas, and can reach a speed of up to 30 mph in short bursts. Few animals are able to escape an orca when it is readying for its next meal. </string>

    <string _locid="140273">Scientific Name: Ailuropoda melanoleuca\nApprox. Size: 30 in. to shoulder, 250 lb.\nDiet: Bamboo\n \nThe Chinese name for the panda, da xiong mao, means “great bear-cat.” The panda is a member of the bear family, and generally resembles other bears in all but its unique black-and-white coloring. Its shaggy fur is white with black patches over the eyes, ears, and legs and a black band across its shoulders. The panda is native to forests high in the central mountains of China.\n \nSince its sole source of food is the bamboo tree, a panda is specially suited to hold, crush, and then consume this tough plant. As if it were not unique enough, the panda has an enlarged sesamoid bone located on the forefoot. This bone holds the nearest tendon slightly further away from the joint than is normal, increasing its movement and enabling a special action similar to that of an opposable thumb. This allows for dexterous grasping. The panda’s teeth and jaws are designed to handle the job of grinding down bamboo shoots. They are bigger and broader than those of other bears, and the jawbones and cheek muscles are incredibly powerful.\n \n160 pandas live in captivity, and their popularity has raised awareness of the animal’s plight in the wild. An estimated 1,600 pandas still live in their natural habitat, but only 60% of them live in protected forests. Saving pandas in the wild has become an important goal for conservationists, one that has sparked the imagination and support of the public. The panda has become an icon for endangered animal causes worldwide.</string>

    <string _locid="140275">Scientific Name: Capra aegagrus\nApprox. Size: 3 ft. to shoulder\nDiet: Grasses, tree branches, shrubbery\n \nThe wild goat is one of the most common goat species. It lives a nomadic existence, often found in mountainous regions across Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Adaptively agile, the wild goat is adept at moving from outcropping to outcropping because of its subunguis, the inner layer of hoof material that allows for maximum shock absorption. The subunguis allows for the constant wearing away of the goat’s hoof, leaving it with a consistently sharp edge for gripping rocky surfaces. The wild goat lives in flocks of 500, with the exception of younger males, which are driven away from the group to live in solitary. This period, called a rut, lasts until the male is ready to mate and it returns to the flock. The typical life span for a wild goat is between 12 and 22 years.</string>

Size: 6 ft., 4,500 lb.\nDiet: Leaves, twigs, fruit\n \nThere are five living species of rhinoceros, three of which are native to Asia, and all of which are endangered. Although its massive body and extremely thick skin garner much attention, the rhinoceros is most commonly known for its horns, one or two depending on the species.\n \nThe rhinoceros horn is composed of the fibrous protein keratin, which makes up the skin cells, hair, scales, and feathers of many animals. Its huge frame is supported by short legs with broad feet, ending in three-toes. Along with the tapir and the horse, the rhinoceros makes up the order of odd-toed hoofed animals. It is an herbivore, a browser, or a grazer, depending on the particular species. During the day, a rhinoceros enjoys the shade, wallowing in the mud to stay cool in the blistering sun. They most often feed by night, or in the cool of the early morning.\n \nOf the three Asian species of rhinoceros, two have a single horn. The Indian rhinoceros, or Rhinoceros unicornis, grazes on the grass of the plains of Nepal, Assam, and Bengal. It can reach weights of up to 2 tons, yet still achieve a running speed of 30 mph. The Indian rhinoceros has an armor-plated appearance due to the deep folds and creases in its fibrous skin. The Javan rhinoceros, or Rhinoceros sondaicus, is nearly extinct. The only two-horned Asian rhinoceros is the Sumatran species, or Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. Its hairy coat and small stature make the Sumatran rhino unique among the five species, for it only reaches a height of about 4.5 feet tall, and a weight of about 1 ton. It is highly endangered. Only a few hundred survive, inhabiting forests in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo. </string>

Size: 2-3 ft., 75-150 lb.\nDiet: Grasses, herbs, shrubs\n \nThe saiga is actually a close relative of the sheep, yet it is usually included in the antelope family because of its close physical resemblance. It is considered an intermediate between the sheep and the antelope. The saiga lives in herds that graze the vast steppe valley linking Kazakhstan, Siberia, and northwestern China. Its geographic range once included Eastern Europe, but poaching has drastically diminished its numbers, and the saiga no longer exists in the region. The populations of China are also at risk because the saiga’s horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine.\n \nThe saiga is instantly recognizable by its strangely shaped, enlarged nose, which droops down over its mouth. In winter, this special nose helps to warm air before it reaches the lungs. In summer, it filters airborne dust and natural pollutants. Bearing a cinnamon-colored coat that thickens and whitens in the winter, the saiga can blend into its environment to avoid predators. It is also a very fast and agile animal, moving up to 80 mph, and can even swim across rivers to reach its destination. Female saiga are especially noteworthy because of their ability to bear young at the early age of eight months.</string>

(females), 200 lb.\nDiet: Fish, squid\n \nOften confused with the seal, the sea lion is a marine mammal with fin feet and external ears. The ears are one of the characteristics that set it apart from the true seal, along with an elongated and flexible neck, and hind flippers that can be rotated to allow for walking out of water. The sea lion is of the eared seal family Otariidae.\n \nThe sea lion has a dark brown coat of thin, short hair that is coarse to the touch. They spend most of their time at sea, coming ashore occasionally to relax on the rocky outcroppings, beaches, and islands. While swimming, they propel their bodies with powerful stroke of their forelimbs, using their hind limbs to steer, like a rudder. Despite their love for the deep sea, sea lions are known to sometimes ascend rivers, but this is not common as migration habits vary from population to population.\n \nThe California sea lion makes its natural home along the Pacific coast of North America from Washington to southern Mexico, in the Galapagos Islands, and in and around the Sea of Japan. Originally, the California sea lion species included three subspecies: Zalophus californianus californianus (California Sea Lion), Zalophus californianus wollebaeki (Galapagos Sea Lion), and Zalophus californianus japonicus (Japanese Sea Lion). The Japanese sea lion is believed to have become extinct in the 1950s, as they were widely hunted and none have been seen since that period. </string>

Size: 25-35 in. to shoulder, 65-100 lb.\nDiet: Bamboo, cypress, leaves, acorns, assorted mountain vegetation\n \nThe Japanese serow, or “Nihon kamoshika,” is a small bovid that lives in the hillside forests and mountain ranges of Japan and Taiwan. There are four color variations: black, black with a dorsal white spot, dark brown, and slightly off-white. Both sexes of serow feature short, slightly curved horns. The serow is a solitary animal, usually living alone, in couples, or in small family clusters that restrict their range to relatively small areas. A serow claims its territory using a black pre-orbital gland that is clearly visible below its eye. The gland secretes a vinegar-like substance that marks the ground in question. As a result of heavy snowfall in the winters, the serow alters its feeding habits, decreasing consumption during the cold winter months. This occurs even in captivity. </string>

Recognizable by its beautiful dusty gray coat that turns white in winter, the snow leopard is in fact an intermediate between the “big cats” and smaller species. Its lack of a cartilaginous hyoid apparatus proves this, as it prevents the snow leopard from being able to roar, a defining trait of lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars.\n \nThe snow leopard lives in the mountainous regions of Asia, in Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Russia, as well as in other nations. During the summer, the snow leopard lives above the tree line at altitudes up to an astonishing 18,000 feet. Its long tail helps to stabilize its movement along rugged and rocky mountain terrain. When winter begins, the leopard descends to an altitude of about 2,000 feet to hunt for prey in the snow-draped forests. The leopard’s large paws act like snowshoes on the fallen snow, displacing the weight and allowing the cat to move quickly through the trees. It can also use its tail as a covering with which it can warm its face or paws.</string>

Although the snow monkey is most commonly known for its frequent visits to volcanic hot springs, such as outside the city of Nagano, it can survive in severe winter temperatures as cold 5° F. A small population of free-range snow monkeys also lives in the state of Texas, in the United States, but it is the only population outside of the monkey’s native Japan. This group was brought overseas in 1972.\n \nThe snow monkey has brown to gray fur, with a red face and bottom, and a short, stubby tail. It lives in multi-male and multi-female social groups with very rigid hierarchies in which infants are born into the social rank of their mothers. The snow monkey is famous for washing its food before eating.</string>

(female)\nDiet: Deer, antelope, wild pigs, cattle\n \n The tiger is one of thirty-six cat species, and most closely related to the lion, leopard, and jaguar, all of which evolved from a common ancestor over 5 million years ago. The tiger is the largest species in the cat family, and the only wild cat with stripes in its fur. Up until the twentieth century, nine different subspecies of tiger roamed the earth, but with the extinction of the Caspian, Javan, and Bali tigers, only six subspecies remain. However, since most tigers are similar both physically and genetically, subspecies are commonly used only to designate a particular tiger’s geographic range. For example, the Sumatran tiger is found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\n \nA tiger’s body is built specifically for the hunt. Certain physical features allow them great advantageous when pursuing, catching, and then consuming its prey. A tiger’s large eyes gather more light than the eyes of other animals, and a special structure called the tapetum lucidum reflects this light, making objects appear brighter than they actually are. A tiger can turn its ears toward the source of a sound to enhance hearing sensitivity. While in pursuit of a smaller animal, a tiger can tighten its stomach muscles and bend its flexible spine like a bow, so when the muscles relax the spine snaps back into position with explosive force, hurtling the cat forward. It even uses its flexible tail as a rudder to aid in steering.</string>

    <string _locid="140299">Japanese legends say that the islands of Japan were formed when gods dipped a jeweled spear into the murky sea, and the trickling droplets fell to become solid earth. After glimpsing the beautiful biodiversity of the region it is easy to understand how such a story came about. The 2,175 miles of Japanese archipelago, stretching north to south, are home to an amazing collection of flora, thanks primarily to the five distinct climate zones that divide Honshu, the three smaller islands, and a chain of over 3,000 smaller islands.\n \nSeventy percent of Japan is covered with forest. Northern Honshu is home to laurel forests of broad-leafed evergreen trees, such as pasania, Japanese evergreen oak, camellia, and holly, and deciduous forests of beech, katsura, maple, oak, and birch. Ficus and fan palm can be found in the west. Moving inland to central Honshu, one would find coniferous trees and deciduous vegetation growing at the mountainous altitudes over 8,000 feet. Long a symbol of Japan, the cherry tree can be found growing naturally in the mountains, although it is also planted throughout the country.</string>

    <string _locid="140301">As a zone of transition between very diverse ecological regions, Mongolia is home with five vegetation zones: taiga forest, mountain forest steppe, steppe, desert steppe, and desert. Typical climatic changes due to altitude and latitude help to form distinct regions of vegetation.\n \n Northern Mongolia is home to the wet, dense, taiga forest zone, a region that covers nearly five percent of the country, and which continues north into neighboring Siberia. The taiga is the world’s largest continuous forest system and consists of a wide range of trees, such as cedar, pine, spruce, and white birch, as well as the Siberian larch, the most widespread species.\n \nCovering twenty-five percent of the land area of Mongolia is the mountain forest-steppe, which is located at lower mountain elevations and around the Selenge-Orhon river basin. This is where the taiga forest meets the steppe, and as a result, the northern slopes are cool and wet, while the southern slopes are warm and wet. The two different areas and climates produce the vegetation common to their bordering sections of taiga and steppe.\n \nRolling grasslands are a prominent feature of the steppe, which makes up most of the eastern part of Mongolia, roughly twenty percent of the country’s land area. The wooded slopes of the steppe are filled with forests of Siberian larch, birch pine and aspen.\n \nEast of the Altay Mountains lies the desert steppe zone, deep in a lake basin that leads into the eastern Gobi desert. This semi desert zone covers about twenty percent of Mongolia. This arid rangeland is utilized by Mongol herders as a popular livestock grazing area. Its brushes and grasses are a favorite of Mongolia's wild horses, called takhi. These beasts are best known for their role as the chosen mount of the steppe rider warriors, who helped win conqueror Genghis Khan his vast Asian empire. The desert steppe features several species of large shrubs that can grow into small trees, such as wormwood, saxaul, and caragana.\n \nMongolia’s southern desert zone rests within the boundaries of the Gobi Desert, and is utterly devoid of trees and other plant life.</string>

    <string _locid="140303">Scientific Name: Bubalus bubalis\nApprox. Size: 6 ft., 2,000 lb.\nDiet: Grass, other sparse vegetation\n \n This huge, gray, mud-wallowing beast is an ungulate, or “hoofed animal,” and a member of the bovine subfamily. Asia is home to 95% of the world’s population of water buffalo, and while it has been domesticated as a draught animal for centuries, some still wander wild in the swamps and grass jungles of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Thailand.\n \nWhile domestic forms are known to be somewhat docile, wild water buffalo are extremely fierce, and can use their widely spread horns (sometimes reaching spans of 6 feet in length) to kill an adult tiger, their only natural predator.</string>
    <string _locid="140304">This predator is guarding a New World Treasure. To collect the Treasure, which may be resources, experience points, or even Settlers or soldiers, the predator or predators guarding it must be killed. Any unit can attack a Treasure guardian, but only Explorers, Settlers, Monks, and War Chiefs can collect the Treasure. </string>
    <string _locid="140305">Scientific Name: Panthera tigris\nApprox. Size: 400-570 lb. (male); 220-350 lb. (female)\nDiet: Deer, antelope, wild pigs, cattle\n \n The white tiger is the result of a genetic mutation that rarely occurs in the wild. A tiger with this gene mutation is often bred for whiteness in captivity, usually to attract visitors to a zoo or refuge. This type of breeding serves no conservation purpose. In addition to its bleached fur, white tigers have deep blue eyes, instead of the usual yellow.\n \nThe tiger is one of thirty-six cat species, and most closely related to the lion, leopard, and jaguar, all of which evolved from a common ancestor over 5 million years ago. The tiger is the largest species in the cat family, and the only wild cat with stripes in its fur. Up until the twentieth century, nine different subspecies of tiger roamed the earth, but with the extinction of the Caspian, Javan, and Bali tigers, only six subspecies remain. However, since most tigers are similar both physically and genetically, subspecies are commonly used only to designate a particular tiger’s geographic range. For example, the Sumatran tiger is found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\n \nA tiger’s body is built specifically for the hunt. Certain physical features allow them great advantageous when pursuing, catching, and then consuming its prey. A tiger’s large eyes gather more light than the eyes of other animals, and a special structure called the tapetum lucidum reflects this light, making objects appear brighter than they actually are. A tiger can turn its ears toward the source of a sound to enhance hearing sensitivity. While in pursuit of a smaller animal, a tiger can tighten its stomach muscles and bend its flexible spine like a bow, so when the muscles relax the spine snaps back into position with explosive force, hurtling the cat forward. It even uses its flexible tail as a rudder to aid in steering.</string>

    <string _locid="140307">Scientific Name: Bos grunniens\nApprox. Size: 2,200 lb. (male)\nDiet: Sparse vegetation\n \n The wild yak once roamed the regions between Kashmir and West China, but extensive hunting has reduced the population to a small number that now graze on elevated plateaus above 14,000 feet. It was hunted primarily for its rich meat and wooly hide. The wild yak, now endangered, has a dark brown coat and may grow to a shoulder height of more than 6 feet. Its body features a humped back, a bushy tail, and a set of long horns that spread outward and upward at the tips.\n \nFor centuries, natives of Tibet have domesticated and crossbred the yak for use as a beast of burden, as well as for its continuous milk supply, used for quality butter and curd. They eventually introduced the domesticated yak to other parts of Asia. It can be recognized by its smaller size and its shorter horns. The domesticated yak’s coat also varies in color, and can be brown, red, black, and even albino.</string>
    <string _locid="140308">Captain Huang attacks with a bow and a sword. He has a special explosive attack called Heavenly Fire. He has many hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Huang can collect Treasure and build Trading Posts near native Settlements and Trade Routes.  </string>
    <string _locid="140309">In a strange twist of fate, Huang’s upbringing somewhat mirrors that of his naval superior, Admiral Zheng He. Like the admiral, Huang was born into a poor ethnic Hui (Chinese Muslims) family in Yunnan Province, a region of Southwest China. At a young age, he was taken into the household retinue of a wealthy lord. Working as a servant, Huang quickly found favor with his lord and gained reputation as being tenacious but fair.\n \nAt the age of twenty, Huang was assigned to the retinue of Zheng He, and was placed in charge of overseeing the loading and preparation of some of the early treasure expeditions. After more than twenty years behind the scenes, Huang was finally promoted to captain in the proposed Sixth Voyage.\n \nAs one more test of his patience and willingness to make the most of a challenging situation, Huang was given command of a ship in the fleet of Admiral Jinhai, a young, cocky member of the imperial family. Once again, Huang had to muster his patience in order to work with the young admiral. Luckily, Huang has made a career out of finding creative ways to solve difficult problems. From the time they first meet, Huang is suspicious of his commander, a suspicion that proves well founded.</string>
    <string _locid="140310">Chen attacks with his bare fists. His powerful Anchor Fist attack can knock multiple enemies right off their feet. He has many hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Chen can collect Treasures, but cannot build Trading Posts.</string>
    <string _locid="140311">Chen sees the world as it is, and he has no use for the posturing of imperial families or the grand ambitions of an emperor. Having spent his whole life as a fisherman and occasional maritime mercenary in and around Fujian Province, Chen knows that life is often like a voyage, meaning that more often than not you are at the mercy of factors out of your control.\n \nChen was recruited for the treasure fleet because of his years of experience, as well as his ability to convince many other local Fuzhou sailors and laborers to contribute their manpower. His reputation as a respected and hardened seaman holds much sway in the region. Much to his surprise, Chen develops an interest in the voyages of the treasure fleet. This happens when he finds friendship with Captain Huang, a long-time military man who is undertaking his maiden voyage as a commander. A huge factor in their relationship is the presence of the young and spoiled Admiral Jinhai, who constantly insults those around him. The admiral’s conceit works to polarize the two older men against him. While Huang, as captain, must remain serious and responsible, it is up to Chen to voice his frustrations for both men, often to humorous effect.</string>
    <string _locid="140312">Jinhai attacks with a bow. He has a lot of hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies.</string>
    <string _locid="140313">Jinhai was born into power as the nephew of the newly risen emperor of the Middle Kingdom (China), Zhu Di. This placed him in a position of unique importance. At the time of Jinhai’s birth, Zhu Di was warring against his other, older nephew for control of the Chinese throne. This combination family dispute and power struggle ended, when Zhu Di and his armies marched on his nephew’s city and ended the man’s short reign as emperor. To avoid any further challenges for power from within his own family, the newly crowned Zhu Di provided his new infant nephew, Jinhai, with everything the boy could ever want. From a tender age, nothing was ever denied him.\n \nThis privilege eventually led to numerous honorary military positions that were not befitting Jinhai’s age or experience. Such constant pampering has left Jinhai with strong delusions of importance, and an inflated sense of self-worth. Most recently, after having only traveled on two earlier voyages as a captain, Jinhai has been elevated to the rank of admiral and placed in command of one of Zheng He’s treasure fleets, along with other more qualified admirals, such as Hong Boa, Zhou Wen, and Yang Qing. Jinhai sees this command as a great opportunity to pursue his own interests and get out from under his uncle’s control.	</string>

Kichiro can collect Treasure and build Trading Posts near Native Settlements and Trade Routes. </string>
    <string _locid="140315">Orphaned at the age of six-years-old, Kichiro was fortunate to be taken in by the powerful daimyo, Tokugawa Ieyasu of Kantô province. He was raised by the members of the Tokugawa clan’s household staff and always under the watchful eye of Ieyasu himself.\n \nWhen Kichiro reached the still young age of fifteen, Ieyasu bestowed upon him the rank of general despite his complete lack of military experience and family name or title. This practice was not unheard of at the time, and many attribute the decision to Tokugawa’s faith in the young boy’s emerging abilities, as well as a desire to directly indoctrinate him with his militaristic ideologies. These ideologies have come into sharp focus with the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the daimyo that consolidated all of Japan’s myriad clans under unified rule. Prepared to make a single, decisive grab at power, Tokugawa has sent his armies out into battle under the command of the passionate Kichiro, who is eager to make his adoptive master proud.\n \nWhat he doesn’t know is that the story of his past is a lie, and that Ieyasu is more responsible for the deaths of Kichiro’s parents than he would ever admit.</string>
    <string _locid="140316">Mototada attacks with a sword. He has many hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Mototada is a Daimyo, he can train units that can be found at both the Barracks and the Stable. Home City Shipments can be sent to his location. Mototada can collect Treasures, but cannot build Trading Posts. </string>
    <string _locid="140317">Daimyo Torii Mototada has known Ieyasu since they were small children, and his family has served the Tokugawa clan for generations. His affable personality hides a serious and focused military mind. On many occasions, Mototada has fought alongside Ieyasu in battle, acting as wise counsel to the younger man despite his subservience.\n \nAs the battle between the Tokugawa armies and the Toyotomi loyalists looms, Mototada has been asked to once again answer his master’s call. Summoned to the field of battle, Mototada gives the young General Kichiro guidance, and over the course of the war becomes attached to the boy. This relationship ends abruptly when the enemy’s armies set out to seize Fushimi Castle, Mototada’s seat of power. Mototada answers the call one last time.\n \nIn the fierce battle that follows, Mototada succeeds in stalling the advancing army and buying his master valuable time to prepare for the pivotal battle of Sekigahara. As Mototada’s commits ritual suicide at battle’s end, he does so in the name of his master, Ieyasu.</string>
    <string _locid="140318">Tokugawa attacks with a sword. He can occasionally decapitate his enemy with a single strike.

Tokugawa can collect Treasures, but cannot build Trading Posts. </string>
    <string _locid="140319">Tokugawa Ieyasu has spent his life making the most of complicated situations, and in doing so he has become Japan’s most feared and unpredictable opportunist. After many years of preying on the weak and taking advantage of shifting alliances, Ieyasu receded into the background as other clans began final campaigns to compete for total power of Japan. During this time, Ieyasu spent his years of peace preparing a strategy in which to usurp the power of the victor, whoever it might be.\n \nIn the end, Ieyasu’s rival Toyotomi Hideyoshi destroyed all his enemies and became the undisputed ruler and unifier of Japan. Still, Ieyasu waited.\n \nWith Toyotomi’s death in 1598, Tokugawa chose to move forward with his campaign to seize control. Ieyasu chose Kichiro to leads his armies because of the boy’s unshakable loyalty to his master. The young Kichiro was raised believing he was taken in by the daimyo as an orphan, when in fact he was orphaned by the daimyo himself. It was Ieyasu who, after declaring victory over a Sakuma clan uprising, ordered the deaths of the Sakuma daimyo and his wife. Only afterwards did he realize that the couple had a child, a six-year-old boy named Kichiro.</string>
    <string _locid="140320">Nanib attacks with a rifle. He has two special abilities, one that inspires those around him into a patriotic fervor, and one that gives him deadly aim against a single target. He has many hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Nanib can collect Treasure and build Trading Posts near Native Settlements and Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="140321">Nanib’s story is like those of most of his sepoy comrades. He was born into a high caste always knowing a world where the British East India Company held influence over the kingdoms of India and surrounding nations.\n \nWhat sets Nanib apart from the other soldiers in his brigade is that he is the only man who chooses to act out against his superiors, taking up arms against Colonel George Edwardson, under whom he has served for more than two years. By making this decision, Nanib finds himself the reluctant commander of an army of traitorous Company soldiers bent on revenge against their British officers.\n \nOf course, the soft-spoken and patient Nanib does not have the warlike instincts expected of a general, and thus he questions his right to lead. Luckily for him, there is a man who perfectly embodies all of Nanib’s resentment towards the Company and its oppression: Colonel George Edwardson. When Nanib recalls the colonel’s many acts of ruthlessness and racism, he finds a purpose for what he is doing. The shy, cautious soldier takes on the role of sepoy general in order to rid India of all the Edwardsons that have plagued it for more than two centuries.\n \nThe character of Nanib Sahir is inspired by the Indian freedom fighter Mangal Pandey, a sepoy who helped spark the first Bharatiya (Indian) War of Independence of 1857. A park has been set up at Barrackpore to commemorate the place where Pandey attacked British officers and was subsequently hanged.</string>
    <string _locid="140322">Colonel Edwardson attacks with a sword. He has the ability to train Sepoys as if he were a moving Barracks. He has many hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Edwardson can collect Treasures, but cannot build Trading Posts.</string>
    <string _locid="140323">After several failed careers, one in law and one in politics, George Edwardson chose to study military history and the art of war, following in the footsteps of his older brother Percy. Interested only in active service, Edwardson traveled to India, where he commanded an army of native sepoys and British troops in the service of the British East India Company.\n \nHis campaigns during the Company’s important annexation of Punjab in 1849 cemented Edwardson’s reputation as a decisive and courageous field commander. With regards to his attitudes towards the Indian population, Edwardson suffered a passionate and radical shift in ideology in 1842, when his brother was killed in the First Anglo-Afghan War. Percy was one of the few unlucky soldiers of the 44th battalion, the British garrison that was surrounded and massacred by Afghan forces. Like much of the British public, Edwardson saw this act as barbarous, and he supported the British army’s devastating retaliation.\n \nThe death of his brother affected Edwardson deeply, and he allowed it to encourage his already racist tendencies towards the regional populations. In the subsequent years, Edwardson became less predictable as an officer and often allowed his personal feelings to guide his strategy. Over time, his name became tainted by a series of controversies regarding his brutality towards sepoy soldiers and innocent civilians. Edwardson simply shrugged off the accusations as “hearsay and misinterpretation.”</string>
    <string _locid="140324">Pravar attacks with a rifle. He has a special ability that gives him deadly aim against a single target. He has many hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Pravar can collect Treasure but cannot build Trading Posts.</string>
    <string _locid="140325">Born into a family of a lower caste, Pravar was indirectly forced into the military when his father died leaving their family without a source of income. Pravar had some experience as a soldier, so the easiest way for him to make money was to pick up a gun in the service of the British East India Company, joining a battalion consisting of men from higher castes and those with more military experience.\n \nThe British officers of Pravar’s brigade disagreed with the discriminations of the Indian caste system and tried to intermingle men of different status and backgrounds. This, of course, was not appreciated by much of the men in their service, and it fueled an already strong hatred of the Company.\n \nAt first, Pravar resented his fellow soldiers, but he quickly realized that regardless of caste, all of them had one thing in common: many of the British saw them as savages, inferior in every way. Keeping his caste a secret, Pravar forged relationships with many other angry soldiers intent on rebellion. To this day, he waits expectantly for the day when they will strike a powerful blow and oust the British from their land.</string>

    <string _locid="140327">The word "Siberia" originates from the Tatar word sibir, which means "sleeping land." This 5,207,900 square mile region has always been characterized as a bleak and desolate locale, despite its abundance of natural resources, including gas, oil, timber, and minerals.\n \nThe region of Siberia consists of the vast Asian portion of Russia, as well as northern Kazakhstan. It is comprised of three distinct geographic areas: the swamplands of the West Siberian Plain, the heights of the Central Siberian Plateau, and the jagged system of mountains that stretches from the Lena River to the Pacific coast. Just southeast of the Central Siberian Plateau lies Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake and home to one-fifth of the earth's fresh surface water and a diversity of plant and animal species.\n \nIn addition to its brutal landscape, the region is blocked from the west by the Ural Mountains, from the north by the Arctic Ocean, from the east by the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Strait, and from the south by China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.</string>

    <string _locid="140329">Indochina is another name for the southeastern Asian peninsula that comprises the territory of the countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Laos. This region is heavily affected by the cultural influence of China, and to a lesser extent India.\n \nThe name French Indochina refers to a former federation of southeastern Asian states comprised of the French protectorates of Cochin China, Tonkin, Annam, Laos, and Cambodia. This federation was located in the easternmost region of the Indochinese peninsula and faced the South China Sea. The people of the region lived under Chinese control from nearly 111 BCE until 939 CE when they achieved independence as the kingdom of Dai Viet. Prior to the sixteenth century the region saw the rise and fall of the Khmer Empire in Cambodia, and the kingdom of Champa in Vietnam.\n \nEuropean influence began as early as the sixteenth century, but it was in the nineteenth century that western powers raced to colonize the area. Early on, the French took Cochin China as a colony and gained protectorates over Cambodia, Annam, and Tonkin. In 1887 they formed those four states into a union of Indochina, headed by a governor-general. Later, in 1893, Laos was added to the union. French control of Indochina officially ended at the Geneva Conference of 1954.</string>
    <string _locid="140330">Banner Armies are the unique way in which the Chinese civilization trains its military units. Instead of purchasing single units, the Chinese purchase blocks of soldiers.  Players cannot choose a single unit, but must purchase two types at a time.  For example, the British can build one Longbow at any time, but Chinese must build three Chu Ko Nu and two Steppe Riders at once. The advantage to Banner Armies is that they generally train faster and are cheaper than the military units of other nations. The different Banner Armies available to train are: Forbidden, Imperial, Ming, Old Han, Standard, and Territorial. There are also other Banner Armies avialable, such as the  Wokou and Mandarin mercenary armies, and the Black Flag and Mongolian armies available from the Castle.</string>

It is generated by Villagers when they work and can then be spent at the Consulate to gain the friendship of European nations. These beneficial alliances allow a player to gain helpful European improvements and expeditionary military forces. The rate at which a player generates Export can be changed at the Consulate, but only with the sacrifice of normal production rates for Wood, Coin, and Food. Amount of Export can be viewed on the resource bar in the center of the screen, and is managed using the buttons that appear when the Consulate is selected.</string>

Each Asian civilization has its own unique Monk: the Japanese have the Sohei Archer warrior monk, the Chinese have the Shaolin Master and Disciple, and the Indians have the elephant-mounted Hindu Brahmin.</string>
    <string _locid="140334">Rather than simply paying to advance in Age, Asian civilizations must build a colossal Wonder in order to advance. When construction of a Wonder is complete, the player moves to the next Age. Each Asian civilization can build five historically inspired Wonders, each with unique bonus powers.\n \nMost Wonders have a long-term and an immediate bonus. The long-term bonuses might be economy enhancements or even God Powers that let the player change the strategic picture in an instant. The short-term powers range from crates of resources to squads of military units. To advance to the next Age, a player must build one Wonder. The initial bonuses granted with each new Wonder becomes more powerful with every Age the building goes unconstructed, so choosing Wonders wisely is critical to both the early and late game.\n \nWonders can be accessed by selecting a Villager and clicking the Age-up button in the screen. This will open the Wonders menus, which displays both the Wonders and their individual bonuses and powers.</string>

    <string _locid="140344">The dominant feature of the ecological region covering the mainland of Asia and extending south into Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam is the deciduous dipterocarp forest, or Indochina Dry Forest. This forest is characterized by a common tree formation comprised of a cluster of deciduous trees, usually the species Dipterocarpaceae. This cluster of trees forms a tight canopy of low vegetation, reaching between 15 and 24 feet in height. The Burmese call this formation idaing, while Cambodians and Laotians call it foret. These dense communities can also become dispersed into scattered forests that feature more typical woodlands, with 50 to 80 percent canopy cover and emergent trees that can reach peaks of 30 to 50 feet.\n \nOnly six of the world’s 550 dipterocarp species are deciduous, and all six of these can be found in the Indochina Dry Forest. The large majority of communities are made up of the species Shorea siamensis, S. obtusa, Dipterocarpus obtusifolius, and D. tuberculatus, with small trees, such as Pterocarpus macrocarpus, Sindora siamensis, and Xylia xylocarpa, making up the thinning areas of scrub and brush.</string>
    <string _locid="140345">One of the most famous Buddhist monasteries is the Shaolin Monastery, located in the Henan province of China, founded in 495 CE. The edifice is associated specifically with Chan Buddhism and the martial art of Kung Fu. Monastery legend states that the Indian monk Bodhidharma visited the temple in 527 CE. During his time meditating on the mountain overlooking the monastery, Bodhidharma taught himself a form of martial arts to defend against wild animals and bandits. He stayed at the temple for nine years, and before his departure he taught his disciples the skills he had learned, creating the martial arts legend that surrounds the Shaolin monks to this day.</string>

The Shaolin Master uses a staff to attack, and when his enemy falls below a certain amount of health, he’ll deal a Divine Strike blow, killing them outright. He guides the training of the Shaolin Disciple, overseeing the young student’s spiritual growth.</string>

    <string _locid="140348">The Daimyo is a Japanese military unit that boasts several special abilities it can use in battle. First, all Daimyo radiate an aura, which is a passive ability that effects the soldiers around them in combat. The Daimyo also serves as a Home City Shipment point, bringing in Shipments to wherever he is on the map. Finally, he can train certain military units in the field, giving the Japanese army the advantage of boosting its numbers in the middle of a fight.</string>
    <string _locid="140349">The daimyo were the great feudal landowners of Japan. Unlike the kuge, or court nobleman, the daimyo were lords of territory and local citizenry, and as such held great power. By the twelfth century the influence of certain daimyo rivaled even the power of the emperor. The first Kamakura shogun, Minamoto no Yoritomo, had been a daimyo, but upon obtaining power in 1192 CE, he established a centralized feudal system. As a result, the shogun’s power quickly weakened during the bloody civil wars occurring between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. By the end of the sixteenth century, one daimyo was quickly growing in power and wealth, rivaling the emperor for power. His name was Tokugawa Ieyasu. Upon becoming shogun in 1603, Tokugawa once again strengthened central power.</string>
    <string _locid="140350">In the early seventeenth century, the Manchu emperor Nurhaci established the Eight Banners - administrative groups into which all families were placed, often based on lineage and tribal connections. These groups were broken down further into companies. Nurhaci wished to create a citizenry that could be called upon to wage war on enemies of the Manchu, as each company was required to furnish a number of soldiers, often 300, that together would form a larger regional banner army.\n \nLater, when Nurhaci’s successors conquered the Mongols and the Han Chinese in the mid-seventeenth century, they incorporated these new warriors into the banner army system. During its height, the Eight Banners system included ethnic Manchu, Han Chinese, and Mongol soldiers. Although it began as a foreign military system forced upon the conquered, the system quickly evolved into the core administrative philosophy behind many government practices, such as the disbursement of salaries, distribution of land, management of property, and oversight of popular welfare and justice matters. </string>
    <string _locid="140351">The Chinese civilization has its own method of building an army, namely through the War Academy, which allows the Chinese to build more military units faster by training them in groups. These groups are called Banner Armies. Each Banner Army has a specialty, whether its speed and anti-infantry, or siege and artillery. The Banner Armies available at the War Academy are: Forbidden Army, Imperial Army, Ming Army, Old Han Army, Mongolian Army, Standard Army, and the Territorial Army.</string>

It can also be upgraded in increments to increase how many units your army can train.  The Village can also train goats as livestock, and serves as a Home City ship point.</string>
    <string _locid="140353">During the late fourteenth century, the time of the Ming Dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor began a new policy of distributing vast amounts of land to local farmers. A product of a rural upbringing, the Hongwu Emperor favored farmers, and parsed the land, giving it to young boys who had reached manhood. To prevent the seizure of this land by corrupt landlords, he established non-transferable land titles and did away with taxation. The response was overwhelmingly positive. In 1393, the amount of land being cultivated rose drastically, at speeds never equaled by a later dynasty.\n \nRealizing that water conservancy would play a crucial part in the success of Chinese agriculture, the Hongwu Emperor focused on irrigation. He dispatched students from the Kuo-tzu-chien, or Imperial College, to develop massive irrigation systems and develop more than 40,000 ponds and dikes. Because of his decisive actions, China experienced an agricultural revolution during the latter half of the fourteenth century.</string>

    <string _locid="140366">Ruling in the nineteenth century, Bahadur Shah II was the last of the Mughal emperors of India. However, his modern-day Mughal Empire hardly stretched beyond the limits of Delhi, and was very much a weakened kingdom, as was the Sikh and the Marathan under British rule. Allowed to rule by the occupiers as an act of public appeasement, Bahadur Shah was merely a figurehead, and his kingdom a mere shadow of the once great Mughal. At the time of the Sepoy resistance of 1857, Bahadur Shah was 82 years old and not nearly as involved as many wanted to believe. Despite his attempts to stay out of matters, he was seen as a unifying icon of India’s historical might and nationalism.\n \nWhen the British quelled the resistance, Bahadur Shah went into hiding, but was eventually captured and then forced to witness the execution of his two sons and grandson. Later, after a show trial, Bahadur Shah was exiled to Rangoon, now Myanmar, where he lived until his death in 1862.\n \nWith the Shah’s exile, a formal end to the Mughal dynasty was declared, and in 1877, the title of “Emperor of India” was assumed by the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria.\n \nIn addition to his role as emperor, Bahadur Shah is revered by many as one of the greatest Urdu poets.</string>

They are relatively inexpensive but fragile; they are not meant for combat, but will defend themselves and others. Villagers can be used to collect Treasures.\n \nEach civilization has a limit to the number of Villagers they can have at once. Villagers pay for themselves rather quickly; and the longer an individual Villager is alive, the greater the contribution to the overall wealth of a given colony. Some civilizations may receive Villagers from defeating guardians, while others have to rely solely on producing them from Town Centers.

    <string _locid="140370">During his rule over the Mughal Empire of India, Akbar the Great brought the whole of his military organization under a new system of administration called the mansabdari. The title was taken from the term “mansab,” which means rank. Officers in the Mughal army were given a mansab and then expected to be servants of the state, with their dismissal or suspension resting directly in the hands of the emperor.\n \nThere were thirty-three grades of mansabdars, differentiated by the Zat and the Sawar. The Zat referred to the number of troops that the mansabdar maintained, while the Sawar referred to the number of horses that he maintained. The number of soldiers under a man’s command could start at ten and rise into the ten thousands. Of course, the highest rank that any common officer could hold only offered a command of 5,000 men. Larger forces were always first allotted to royal princes. Yet, after the death of Akbar at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the grades were increased. Common officers could reach the mansabdar grade corresponding to a command of over 20,000 men.\n \nHowdah is the traditional name for a carriage that is strapped across an elephant’s back, allowing it to carry human riders, including the “mahout,” the beast’s human handler. Howdahs often featured grand decoration and were used as processional carriages. Early Mughal rulers preferred travel by elephant because of the impression it made, both during peacetime and at war. Although elephants have been used in warfare for centuries, the Mauryan Empire of ancient India first used the howdah in combat in about 300 BCE. Soon afterwards, elephant howdahs provided safety to many Carthaginian archers and javelineers during the Punic Wars of 264-146 BCE.\n \nIn battle, elephants with ornate howdahs acted as standard bearers, visual representations of the army’s might. More importantly, they provided a relatively safe location from which ranged units could gain a more expansive view of the battlefield and fire on their enemy from above. From this elevated vantage point, they could choose their targets more effectively.</string>

In Hindu culture, elephants were highly respected as a manifestation of the elephant god Ganesh, the god of good luck. Having elephants participate in a festival or procession was required for every celebratory occasion, and being the mahout who cared for a great elephant on such an occasion was a great honor.\n \nOften considered the natural predecessor of the modern-day tank, the elephant brought many unique elements to its role as a battlefield unit. Early successes had more to do with surprise and intimidation than battlefield effectiveness. Enemy horses or camels, whether frightened by the beast’s smell, or overwhelmed by its sheer size, proved powerless against the elephant. It trampled oncoming waves of infantry and knocked riders from their mounts, scattering ranks and causing general confusion. It had a similar effect on the human enemy, terrifying many men to the point of panic. Yet, as armies became more accustomed to fighting elephants in battle, the methods of how to defeat them became evident.\n \nThe most famous event involving a triumph over elephants occurred in 1398, when the Mongol conqueror Timur invaded India to overthrow the Delhi Sultanate. At a loss for how to fight back against the Indian’s elephants, Timur prayed to Allah for guidance. Then, according to legend, he attached straw to the backs of the camels in his army and sent them out to fight. When the camels neared the elephants, Timur had his men ignite the straw. The sight of the stampeding, flaming camels spooked the elephants so badly that they ended up crushing many Indian troops in their rush to escape.</string>

For 200 years, the Gurkhas expanded eastward, seeking to conquer all of Nepal. They succeeded, and by the mid-eighteenth century, the entire country was theirs and Hinduism was named the state religion. The Gurkhas attempted to invade Tibet but ultimately failed, and as war with the British broke out in India, they found their control waning. They did, however, discover a surprisingly fruitful partnership with the British occupational forces in India.\n \nKnown for their short, curved sword called a kukri, the Gurkhas served in the armies of India and of Great Britain, where more than 200,000 soldiers fought alongside the British in World War I, and in forty battalions in World War II.</string>

Taking great pride in their ancestry and its emphasis on military virtues, the Rajput grew in power until 1616, when all the major clans had no choice but to submit to the might of Akbar and his Mughal Empire.\n \nThe Rajput warriors were known for using the unique and deadly pata, a sword-like weapon where the blade and the gauntlet were integrated into a single piece that was held by the wielder. Earlier iterations of the pata were said to have started at 10 inches in length, with later variations reaching a length of nearly 44 inches. This sturdy blade was effective at repelling armored cavalry, but could also be used in assaults against infantrymen, swung and slashed like a traditional sword. Supposedly, Emperor Akbar himself used the pata in battle, most notably during the siege of Gujarat in 1576.</string>

The mutiny erupted when a group of sepoys refused to use their new Lee-Enfield rifles. Loading the rifles required the soldiers to bite off the ends of greased cartridges, and rumors that the cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs had circulated through the ranks. This outraged both Hindus, who regard cows as sacred, and Muslims, who regard pigs as unclean. After years of British mistreatment and disrespect, the sepoys found they had endured enough.</string>

Elephants had many different military uses both on and off the battlefield. Females were often used as pack animals, while males were equipped and ridden into combat. The thickness of an elephant’s hide was natural protection against projectiles, such as arrows, while its incredible strength allowed it to trample incoming infantry and startle cavalry. Generals and officers often used elephants to gain a heightened view of the battlefield, enabling better tactical movement. The use of war elephants spread west from India as western rulers incorporated them into their armies. The most notable example of this was when the Carthaginian warlord, Hannibal, used war elephants against the Romans in 264 BCE.\n \nWhile elephants were not very effective as siege weapons, many armies tried to capitalize on the beast’s strength or size when attacking enemy fortifications. In some instances, the elephant’s strength and tusks alone were enough to topple a wall. In other situations, light cannon, such as culverins, were mounted on the Howdah, or carriage, that was secured atop an elephant’s back.</string>

Once training commences, it progresses through four unique stages of development: Meithari, Kolthari, Ankathari and Verumkai. Meithari is a rigorous series of posture and coordination exercises that helps the student achieve peak physical condition through jumps, balance, and flexibility. Kolthari is the study of fighting with wooden weapons. Ankathari is the study of metal weapons, and near the end of this stage a student chooses a weapon in which to specialize. Finally, once the student has mastered all forms of weaponry, he is taught how to defend himself in hand-to-hand combat using grapples, blows, and strikes to vital pressure points, or marmam. Only the most trusted students of Kalarippayattu are instructed in this honored art.\n \nMasters of Kalarippayattu are highly skilled in many weapons, but none as strange, or as deadly, as the urumi, or flexible sword. The urumi is a flexible band of steel about one inch in width, and up to 5 feet in length, that is attached to a handle. Most urumi have multiple bands attached to a single handle. Because of its flexibility, an urumi can be coiled around the waist and inconspicuously carried like a belt. If a fight breaks out, the urumi can be uncoiled and swung like a sword. It is most effective when the wielder faces multiple enemies.</string>

It has an inspiring affect on all nearby non-Mansabdar units of the same type, increasing their attack and hitpoints. The Zamburak is an Indian light cavalry unit. It’s extremely fast and cheap but has fewer hitpoints than other cavalry units. Its mounted gun gives the Zamburak good range, and it inflicts the worst damage on heavy cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="140388">During his rule over the Mughal Empire of India, Akbar the Great brought the whole of his military organization under a new system of administration called the mansabdari. The title was taken from the term “mansab,” which means rank. Officers in the Mughal army were given a mansab and then expected to be servants of the state, with their dismissal or suspension resting directly in the hands of the emperor.\n \nThere were thirty-three grades of mansabdars, differentiated by the Zat and the Sawar. The Zat referred to the number of troops that the mansabdar maintained, while the Sawar referred to the number of horses that he maintained. The number of soldiers under a man’s command could start at ten and rise into the ten thousands. Of course, the highest rank that any common officer could hold only offered a command of 5,000 men. Larger forces were always first allotted to royal princes. Yet, after the death of Akbar at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the grades were increased. Common officers could reach the mansabdar grade corresponding to a command of over 20,000 men.\n \nA zamburak is a small weapon carried on and fired from the back of a camel. The name comes from the Arabic “zambur,” meaning hornet. Before gunpowder, early versions of the camel-mounted gun featured a bolt-firing crossbow that produced a buzzing twang at discharge, which gave the weapon its name. In later years the crossbow was replaced with a small culverin or falconet attached to the rider’s saddle. The zamburak originated in Egypt, and spread to Iran, India and elsewhere. Attempts to adapt the idea to elephants proved generally unsuccessful, as the beasts would not remain steady under intense enemy fire.</string>
    <string _locid="140356">The Town Center is the heart of every colony or village. Gatherers are trained here. Shipments from the Tribal Council or Home City arrive here. The improvements that advance your colony through the Ages are here. Town Centers provide population spaces, or slots, for your total population limit. In the Fortress Age, units which can construct new Town Centers become available from the Tribal Council or Home City. The Tribal Council can provide Town Travois to build new Town Centers, while the Home City provides Covered Wagons and Rickshaws to build new Town Centers. Town Travois, Covered Wagons, and Rickshaws are available in limited numbers.\n \nIf your town comes under attack, there is a Minutemen button in European Town Centers that drums up the militia for your town's defense. In Asian towns, there are two buttons, one for ranged Irregulars and one for melee Sentries. In Native towns, this defense comes from the Call the People Ceremony at the Community Plaza. Both of these measures are for emergencies only, since these fighters aren't meant to be used as regular warriors. There is also a button called the Town Bell that calls all your gatherers to the Town Center to hide from attacks. While inside, the gatherers fire at any attackers nearby. Pressing the Town Bell button again sends your gatherers back to work.</string>
    <string _locid="140357">During the Qing Dynasty, beginning in the seventeenth century, Chinese way of life was undergoing a drastic shift, as powerful Manchu rulers of the Qing were conquering and occupying large portions of the Chinese empire. Manchus faced a challenge in controlling an enormous population, one that had long-held resentment towards foreign rule. Communities were a focal point of the Manchu strategy to win over the populace. Roughly 80 to 90 percent of administrative posts were given to native Han Chinese, while the most powerful positions were reserved for Manchu tribesman or Chinese collaborators.\n \nThe rule of the Manchu brought about extensive agricultural reforms that benefited the peasants of China, and stimulated cultivation of land that led to vast commercial expansion. As a result, daily life improved. Markets and tea houses thrived. Storytellers and performers spread aspects of cultural usually reserved for the elite. At the same time, members of the wealthy class invested their additional income in libraries, gardens, orphanages, medical clinics, and even volunteer firefighting organizations. Peasants and rich alike were enriching their communities.\n \nJapan’s Sengoku, or Warring States period, occurred between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, and was a time of seemingly endless conflict. Constant fighting between the nation’s nearly 250 individual daimyo, or feudal landowners, had created a way of life completely focused on survival. If a daimyo was not fighting to defend his land and peasants, he was striving to win the land and peasants of his enemy.\n \nAs a damiyo waged war, his region’s every resource was channeled into the subsistence of his soldiers and the maintenance of his campaign, the length of which was always a defining factor. Villagers were sent ahead of all marching armies to work the land and provide for the soldiers that followed. If they came under attack, peasants would hurry into hiding in the surrounding countryside or a temple, and wait out the battle. To form a supply train, or konidatai, human and animal porters were sent back-and-forth into the field of battle to deliver goods, often under the watchful eye of a supply master. The farther from home an army became, the less likely it would continue. Since resource scarcity was such a concern, it was not uncommon for a daimyo to abandon a campaign and return to his home, only to focus his ambitions and the efforts of his vassals on planning for a future conflict.\n \nDuring the reign of the Mughal Empire’s greatest ruler, Akbar, society was organized under a feudal system. Under the emperor, the warrior aristocracy, known as mansabdars, held ranks that were based on the size of their personal armies, which then indicated salary and obligation to the government. The mansabdars were paid from revenues generated by villages existing specifically for that purpose, called jagirs.</string>
    <string _locid="140358">Docks can only be built along the shoreline. They train Fishing Boats, Canoes (if you are allied with Native Americans), Caravels, Junks, and a number of tougher ships of the like as they become available.\n \nIf your Fishing Boats come under attack and you can't fight your enemy off, you can hide your fishing fleet in the Dock. Fishing Boats garrisoned in a Dock cannot fish, but they give the Dock the ability to fire on enemy units - so not only are your boats safe, they can defend themselves as well.</string>
    <string _locid="140359">The world’s first shipyard is believed to have been constructed around 2500 BCE, in the ancient coastal city of Lothal of the Harappan civilization, in what is now the Indian state of Gujarat. Craft built in these dockyards most likely traded with the ancient Middle Eastern kingdom of Mesopotamia.\n \nDocks provide places for ships to load and unload passengers and goods. A group of docks is referred to as a dockyard. Towns often grow up around docks because they provide a convenient means of trade. This trend is evident in the northeastern section of the United States.</string>
    <string _locid="140360">Barracks were constructed in the British colonies when colonists tired of housing British regulars for two straight years during the French and Indian War. Hostilities escalated as increasing numbers of troops were sent to defend the Crown's interests. More and more settlers were required by law to provide shelter to the soldiers. Eventually the dissatisfaction amongst colonists grew so strong that Lord Laudon, General in Chief of America, agitated for the construction of a number of barracks to house the soldiers.\n \nDuring the nineteenth century occupation of India, the British military was known for erecting barracks wherever it pleased. One notorious example was when buildings of the monumental Agra Fort were demolished to make room for soldiers’ quarters that still stand today.\n \nIn feudal Japan, warriors did not reside in a common structure but rather inhabited a tent city near the battlefield. The general commanded from his office tent, or bakufu, a word which came to symbolize the temporariness of a military authority. Over time the term became a synonym for “shogunate,” a form of government based on military dictatorship.\n \nThe Third Amendment of the U.S. Constitution specifically prohibits the requirement by law for citizens to house soldiers.</string>
    <string _locid="140389">Mercenaries are usually very strong versions of their base unit type, whether melee or ranged, infantry or cavalry. They can be sent from the Home City or Tribal Council after they are unlocked. They are the only Home City Shipments that cost Coin.\n \nAsian civilizations can train repentant mercenaries from the Monastery, while European civilizations can train mercenaries from the Saloon. Different units are available on different maps. Look for Ninjas on the Great Plains or Mamelukes in Araucania. Mercenaries are a good choice to send or train if you have the Coin to spare, especially if your enemy is using them.</string>
    <string _locid="140390">The Elmeti were non-noble knights of Italy. Their name is derived form the Italian term for helmet, referring to the headgear they wore along with their finely crafted plate armor. The Elmeti fought in a series of skirmishes between Italy and other European states during the latter half of the fifteenth century. One key battle occurred in 1487 at Ponte di Crevola, where the Milanese army, led by Trivulzio, defeated Swiss forces in a battle that foreshadowed nearly a half century of further European encroaches into Italy - a period now known as the Italian Wars.</string>
    <string _locid="140391">The first flintlocks appeared in the early 1600s, and quickly spread across Europe. The flintlock applied mechanical principles to strike flint to steel, using the resulting spark to ignite black powder and send a bullet (or ball) on its way. Extremely reliable under almost all conditions (including rainy weather), the flintlock musket remained the primary weapon for infantry for nearly 200 years, up to and including the U.S. Civil War.</string>
    <string _locid="140392">Artillery has existed for hundreds of years, practically since the invention of gunpowder. Early artillery, such as the great bombard, was extremely large, heavy, and difficult to maneuver across the field of battle. Military tacticians envisioned the value of more lightweight pieces, leading to the creation of the first mortars in the mid-seventeenth century. Armies soon discovered that the tradeoff in firepower for increased mobility was valuable in certain situations. Today, the mortar and similar weapons play a strong role in the blend of weaponry used in modern combat scenarios.</string>
    <string _locid="140393">Shrouded by the mists of time, the exploits of the ninja continue to fire imaginations across the globe. During the turbulent years of Japan's sixth and seventh centuries, a secret class of warrior priests emerged. Rulers of opposing factions came to value the ninja for their skills in stealth, combat, and espionage.\n \nAs the centuries passed, the legendary powers of the ninja grew: invisibility, shape-shifting, flight; even the ability to pass through solid walls. Modern filmmakers blend historical fact with ancient myth to fashion a portrait of a warrior class that continues to fascinate and terrify.</string>
    <string _locid="140394">The name “comanchero” refers to those non-indigenous people, especially the Spanish, who traded with the Comanches of New Mexico. During the late 1800s in the U.S. Southwest, comancheros inhabited a shadowy world of commerce between dealers of guns, ammunition, and other forbidden commodities with the local Native Americans. Even though the Lakota, Apache, and other Native Americans were quite often provided firearms by the U.S. military, a significant black market emerged that the comancheros were more than happy to exploit.</string>
    <string _locid="140395">On a dusty street, two steely eyed men grimly face one another. A moment of dread anticipation as a tumbleweed rolls past.. and then, two hands slap leather and pistols bark death. When the smoke passes, only one man still stands.\n \nThe mythos of the American Old West would not be nearly so compelling without its archetypal protagonist: the gunslinger (or pistolero). Their names have become the stuff of legend: Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp and his gun fight at the OK Corral.\n \nBut the reality of a gunfight is never quite as dramatic as depicted. The epic mano-a-mano showdown in the street is more a fixture of Hollywood than history. Most fights resembled drunken brawls, often involving fists and blades rather than bullets. And while some of the most famous gunslingers did meet their makers through showdown or ambush, many others simply passed away after living out their days recounting tall tales of improbable glory. </string>
    <string _locid="140396">The broad expanses of the North American Old West offered many different opportunities to make one's fortune – either within the boundaries of the law, or by simply preying on others who had already done so. Anyone known as a rengado - Spanish for “renegade” - was almost certainly a gruff and surly individual who had little use for society’s traditions or laws. Mark Twain’s “A Horse’s Tale” mentions one such character, “Trap-robber, horse-thief, squaw-man, renegado - Hank Butters - I know him very well.”</string>
    <string _locid="140397">The Shaolin Monk's obedient student can be sent from the Home City or trained by the Shaolin Master himself. The Disciple can help explore, find Treasures, and fight enemies. In battle, he is capable of lashing out with a powerful Critical Strike. If he is hurt badly, the Disciple is disabled and must be rescued.</string>
    <string _locid="140398">This animal can be hunted for Food by gatherers - Settlers, Coureurs des Bois, Settler Wagons, Cree Coureurs, and Villagers. Japanese Villagers cannot hunt, and must gather Food using Cherry Orchards, Rice Paddies and Fishing Boats. </string>
    <string _locid="140399">This animal can be fished for Food by gatherers, such as Fishing Boats, Fune, Canoes, and Caravels. </string>
    <string _locid="140400">This predator is guarding a Treasure. To collect the Treasure, which may be resources, experience points, or even Settlers or soldiers, the predator or predators guarding it must be killed. Any unit can attack a Treasure guardian, but only Explorers, Settlers, Monks, and War Chiefs can collect the Treasure. </string>
    <string _locid="140401">These herdable animals can be hunted for Food by gatherers - Coureur des Bois, Cree Coureurs, Settlers, Settler Wagons, and Villagers. Unlike wild animals, these animals can be captured and sent back to your colony. If they are alone traveling back to your colony, another player may stumble across them and steal them away from you.\n \nHerdable animals "fatten" over time, so the longer they are alive, the more Food they will provide when your gatherers finally hunt them. They will fatten even faster at a Livestock Pen or Village.</string>
    <string _locid="140402">This berry bush provides Food when any gatherer works on it - Settlers, Coureurs des Bois, Settler Wagons, Cree Coureurs, and Villagers. The Food is slow and limited, but safe to collect since the bushes often grow near Town Centers.</string>
    <string _locid="140403">This ore deposit can be mined for Coin by gatherers - Settlers, Coureurs des Bois, Settler Wagons, Cree Coureurs, and Villagers.</string>
    <string _locid="140404">This animal can be fished for Coin by gatherers - units like Fishing Boats, Caravels, Funes, and Canoes.</string>
    <string _locid="140405">This horse-drawn artillery unit offers good speed and mobility at a relatively low cost. The Horse Artillery unit enables you to position cannon easily and quickly during a battle.</string>
    <string _locid="140406">Sometime around the sixteenth century, military planners began to see the value of using horses to maneuver light artillery to the front lines of battle. European records show that some commanders integrated their horse artillery units with infantry units and even cavalry. The mobility of horse artillery units offered military leaders increased options in dealing with fluid and rapidly changing battlefield conditions.</string>
    <string _locid="140407">The Trading Post can only be built on certain places on a given map. These places are special sites located near Native American settlements, Asian religious sites, or along Trade Routes. An Explorer, Settler, Monk, or Villager can build the Trading Post on one of these pre-placed sites. If built at a Native settlement, it establishes an alliance with the tribe there. If built near a Trade Route, it establishes a post where the passing trade unit - a Travois, Stage Coach, Rickshaw, or Train - delivers goods as it passes.\n \nAllying with Natives allows a player to train special Native units, usually warriors, and also grants access to a group of improvements to that tribe. Native units do not cost any population spaces, but can only be built in limited numbers.\n \nBuilding a Trading Post along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or the speed at which you may request Shipments from the Home City. An improvement in the Trading Post increases the speed at which the trade unit delivers goods. The route starts out serviced by a lone Travois; as you improve it, it becomes a Stage Coach and finally a Train. For Asian civilizations, players begin with a one-man Rickshaw that upgrades to a Trade Cart.\n \nAnyone who has built a Trading Post along a Trade Route is granted line of sight around the trade unit. This means that as the trade unit passes into the Fog of War or completely unexplored areas, you will be able to see what is immediately beyond the Train.</string>
    <string _locid="140408">Perhaps the world's most famous trade route is the network of ancient trade passages known as the Silk Road, which developed over a 2,000-year period. Stretching over 5,000 miles and connecting the Mediterranean with the eastern reaches of China, the Silk Road was a significant factor in the establishment and growth of many of the world's most enduring civilizations, including China, Egypt, Persia, Rome, and Mesopotamia.\n \nTrading posts were established by early explorers of the New World as places to stop, barter, rest, and engage in commercial activities in support of their efforts to find wealth for their patrons, usually kings and queens, who sponsored their voyages.\n \nWealthy and powerful trading companies between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries competed viciously as they drove exploration of the New World in search of pelts (chiefly beaver), to market in Europe. They dotted the landscape with trading posts and continued driving west in search of new sources of pelts. The fur trade and the need for the trading posts declined as fashions in Europe changed and the demand for pelts collapsed. Many trading posts developed into proper settlements over time.</string>
    <string _locid="140409">This Holy Site is identical to a Native Trade Site. Allying with Natives allows a player to train special Native units, usually warriors, and also grants access to a group of improvements to that tribe. Native units do not cost any population spaces, but can only be built in limited numbers.\n \nOne of the most famous Buddhist monasteries is the Shaolin Monastery, located in the Henan province of China, founded in 495 CE. The edifice is associated specifically with Chan Buddhism and the martial art of Kung Fu. Monastery legend states that the Indian monk Bodhidharma visited the temple in 527 CE. During his time meditating on the mountain overlooking the monastery, Bodhidharma taught himself a form of martial arts to defend against wild animals and bandits. He stayed at the temple for nine years, and before his departure he taught his disciples the skills he had learned, creating the martial arts legend that surrounds the Shaolin monks to this day.</string>

    <string _locid="142051">The Stats panel displays detailed stats of the selected unit or building.\n \nHitpoints: An attribute that represents how much damage a unit or building can take. \n \nSpeed: An attribute that shows how fast a unit moves on land or sea. Speed allows units to engage into battle alot quicker than normal speed units. Speed also allows units to flee or quickly retreat which makes them harder to catch. \n \nResists: An attribute that represents how much defense against attacks and damage a unit has. Resistance reflects agility, armor, or the general toughnes of a unit. \n \nRanged Attack: Range is the farthest distance a unit can fire or throw a weapon. Units with ranged attacks tend to do well against melee units.\n \nSiege Attack: An attribute that does damage to buildings. Units with a high siege attack are good at destroying buildings and walls. Artillery have a high siege attack, as do an assortment of other units like Halberdiers and Russian Oprichniks.\n \nHand Attack: Refers to melee damage a unit can deal. Units with big hand attacks generally do more damage.</string>

    <string _locid="142054">The Nizam Fusilier is a unique Ottoman ranged multi-purpose infantry unit that is only available through the New Order Infantry Mosque improvement. It has several advantages over other infantry units: it can undertake a speedy bayonet charge into enemy lines, and its attack and armor values are specialized by formation: each one grants a different set of attributes.</string>
    <string _locid="142055">Following devastating defeats at the hands of Russia and Austria, the Sultan Selim III (1761-1807) realized that the once-mighty Ottoman army required reforming to remain on par with that of its rivals. Modern drilling and the use of bayonets were among the improvements made to these new Ottoman infantry units; however, this new corps was soon engaged in a bitter rivalry with the Janissaries, elite troops of the Ottoman Empire. While this internal strife occasionally affected morale and caused violent incidents, the Nizam corps were more effective than their predecessors, even if they could not fully turn the tide against the Empire’s powerful enemies.</string>

    <string _locid="160000">The Inca were a pre-Colombian Andean civilization that, according to legend, emerged from a series of caves sometime in the 12th century. Living a pastoral lifestyle in modern-day Peru for some time, they eventually migrated to the Urubamba valley during the 13th century. Under their leader, the semi-legendary Manco Capac, the Inca seized control of the city of Cuzco and founded their kingdom there.\n \nIn 1438, the ambitious ruler Cusi Yupanqui (1418-1472), known also as Pachacuti “The Earth Shaker” undertook a series of massive expansionist campaigns, dealing first with local enemies such as the fierce Chanca, then defeating the rival forces of his treacherous brother Urqu, and finally triumphing over the advanced and warlike Chimu civilization, which would go on to supply the Inca with some of their most feared warriors. Matching his military prowess with impressive administrative feats and reforms, Pachacuti organized his domain into Tawantinsuyu “The Four Regions”, more commonly termed the Inca Empire, and became its first Sapa Inca, or emperor.\n \nPachacuti’s successor, Topa Inca Yupanqui (1441-1493), having accumulated considerable battle experience fighting under his father--traditionally, it was actually the son of the Sapa Inca who led the Inca forces in combat--continued Pachacuti’s expansionist policies. By the end of his reign, the Inca Empire had more than doubled in size. His son, Huayna Capac (1468-1524) was a skilled warrior as well as an administrator: vast territorial gains were accompanied by improvements to infrastructure, from fortresses and observatories to agricultural reforms and the expansion of the road network traversing the Inca Empire.\n \nAt their height, the Inca were among the most advanced civilizations of their time. A vast road network connected all constituent regions, enabling efficient and swift travel. During the late 15th century, the Inca constructed over 10,000 tambos--administrative buildings that were staffed by locals conscripted through the mit’a corvee system--along these roadways. Agricultural productivity was bolstered by a vibrant and bustling trade network, and the bureaucracy managed these vast systems with the help of an ingenious calendar and the use of quipu, knotted strings that functioned as a writing system of sorts, for record-keeping.\n \nThe standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. Inca warriors wore cloth armor that breathed well, allowed for free movement, and dissipated the force of blows. Drawing on the resources of a vast empire, the Inca recruited warriors from numerous subordinate tribes with their own military traditions, resulting in an extremely diverse and versatile military force. Battles tended to open with a hail of projectile weaponry before the forces closed in brutal melee combat.\n \nSpirituality also played a considerable role within the Inca Empire. Inca religion combined a complex set of ceremonial rites, animism, and, above all, worship of the sun-god Inti, who was considered the father of the Sapa Inca. The priestly class that presided over this system commanded immense social and political influence as curators of the people’s spiritual welfare and relationship with the divine. A major focus of this system was the impressive temple complex at Saqsahuaman, near Cuzco.\n \nProsperity was not to last, however. An epidemic, probably smallpox spread by Spanish explorers, decimated the Inca population in the early 16th century. Simultaneously, the Inca Empire was rent by a bloody civil war between the brothers Atahuallpa and Huascar. Just as the war ended, Spanish conquistadors under Francisco Pizarro pounced on the weakened Inca in 1532, killing the Sapa Inca and swiftly subjugating the region. Manco Inca Yupanqui (1515-1544) led the surviving Inca in a desperate and initially successful war of resistance, but was slain by Spanish conquistadors after a decade in power. In 1572, the last Inca stronghold at Vilcabamba was seized and its ruler, Topa Amaru, executed. The Inca Empire, a marvel for the ages, had been extinguished.</string>
    <string _locid="160001">The early-modern Swedish state first emerged during the 16th century when, after decades of tension between the monarchy and nobility, Gustav I Vasa (1496-1560, r. 1523-1560) ascended to the throne. His greatest contribution to the state was emancipating it from mercantile domination at the hands of the Hanseatic League, a trading organization based in Germany that had essentially monopolized overseas trade in the Baltic and, to a lesser extent, the North Sea. Consequently, the Swedish peasantry flourished and the region entered a period of economic prosperity.\n\nThis period of state formation coincided with the Protestant Reformation, which incited vitriolic and sinister tension between Protestants and Catholics. While temporarily suffering due to recurring violence accompanying the ebb and flow of Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Sweden was soon established as a Protestant state when Karl IX (r. 1604-1611) deposed his rival Sigismund III. From this point onward, Sweden became heavily involved in the politics and religious conflicts of the continent.\n\nUnder Karl’s successor, Gustavus Adolphus (1594-1632; r. 1611-1632), Sweden entered a golden age. Despite ascending to the throne at age 16 and being saddled with three inherited wars, Gustavus managed to stabilize his realm, concluding several largely favorable treaties and implementing a series of political, economic, and social reforms to secure domestic welfare while his military reforms revolutionized the Swedish army and navy. The combination of mobile field artillery with mobile cavalry and aggressive, versatile infantry tactics made the Swedish army deadly in battle. When Gustavus intervened in the Thirty Years’ War, not only did he salvage the Protestant cause; he even managed to conquer much of the Holy Roman Empire before dying in battle in 1632.\n\nOver the following decades, Sweden’s success on the battlefield in Scandinavia and in continental Europe led to the establishment of the Swedish Empire. During this time, Swedish migrants attempted the settlement of Africa and the Americas, but with marginal success. Overextended to begin with, their overseas possessions were swiftly lost or sold, most notably New Sweden in the Delaware River Valley, which was seized by the Dutch by 1655. Temporary instability was resolved by the powerful monarchs Karl XI (r. 1660-1697) and Karl XII (r. 1697-1718), who revived an economy weary from decades of warfare and further reformed the Swedish military into the fearsome Carolean army, an elite and versatile military force that conducted several successful campaigns into Russia and Poland-Lithuania.\n\nDespite the catastrophic Great Famine of 1695-1697, Sweden continued to expand, but was halted in the early 18th century by a staunch Russian defense that utilized scorched earth tactics and the brutal Russian winter to deadly effect. The Swedish Empire subsequently lost control of most of its overseas possessions. In an effort to reassert its control over the western reaches of the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself with the anti-French coalition during the Napoleonic Wars, managing to seize control of Norway in 1814. This marked the end of Swedish expansionism, however, as neutrality was pursued thenceforth while Sweden endeavored to industrialize and modernize its economic and political structure. A notable byproduct of these processes was the mass emigration of Swedes to the United States of America, where citizens of Swedish ancestry still constitute a considerable minority of the population.</string>
    <string _locid="160002">The history of the United States begins millennia ago with the indigenous peoples who migrated into the North American continent and settled throughout, creating culturally and linguistically distinct societies. The majority of these were founded on hunter-gatherer subsistence, but some also practiced agriculture and engaged in activities such as metallurgy, nautical navigation, and long-distance trade. By the time that the first European explorers reached the continent, these societies had been living in harmony with their surroundings for roughly 10,000 years. In contrast, Europeans such as the Icelanders under Leifr Eiriksson who sailed to modern-day Newfoundland c. 1000 CE failed to adapt to the local climate and thus left or disappeared.\n\nBy the 15th century, Europe was undergoing a process of social and economic revolutions marked by, among other things, massive population booms and vibrant trade economies. An allure for luxury resources brought on by the taste that they had through trade partners in the Middle East spurred a desire to explore and establish settlements so as to have direct access to these resources. After Christopher Columbus stumbled upon the Caribbean islands while seeking an alternative western route to East Asia, European settlers began to flock to the so-called “New World” seeking land, wealth, and religious freedom, among other things.\n\nWhile a select few instances of peaceful coexistence did transpire, their interactions with the local indigenous populations were on the whole fraught with discord and friction. European settlers often treated the natives callously and seized land by force, a theme that would continue throughout the majority of the continent’s history. Exposure to new and devastating diseases wiped out entire native populations and the shifting balance of power spelled the end of the lives of the indigenous peoples as they knew it. Some integrated with the expanding European settlements, but most were driven away from their ancestral homelands or died off, not least due to certain European settlers’ nefarious practice of using manipulative diplomacy to spark conflict between nearby tribes before capitalizing on the weakened remnants.\n\nBy the 18th century, the main European powers in North America were the British, the French, and the Spanish. The Seven Years’ War (1754-1763) resulted in the British establishing dominance over the eastern seaboard, whose disgruntled inhabitants became restless under the yoke of foreign domination, exorbitant taxes, and intrusive legal measures. In the early 1770s, this tension erupted into the American Revolution when, after some minor skirmishes, the Continental Congress convened in the city of Philadelphia and signed and then ratified the Declaration of Independence -- a document composed primarily by Thomas Jefferson -- on July 4, 1776.\n\nUnder the steadfast leadership of George Washington -- who would later be elected the nation’s first president -- and the intervention of France, whose Marquis de La Fayette was instrumental in improving the discipline of the American armed forces, the revolution succeeded and the Americans set about establishing a democratic system of government. In 1803, the nation’s territory vastly expanded when it acquired the so-called Louisiana Purchase from France, but could not immediately focus on settling it; war with Britain broke out once more in 1812 and, while largely a stalemate, lasted until 1814-1815. At this time, several former European imperial possessions in Central and South America were likewise attaining their independence, and the United States moved to assist these new states by threatening military involvement should their former rulers attempt to retake them.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 19th century, American settlers thrust into the central and western regions of the continent, often showing blatant disregard for the native populations inhabiting those regions, who were wiped out, evicted, or forced onto reservations. Pioneering homesteads gradually evolved into forts and towns thriving on agricultural prosperity, trade, and rich natural resources. However, the nation was rife with division between its northern and southern halves. Policy in nearly all spheres of life diverged: the northern regions were more urban and industrial, while the southern regions were dominated by agriculturalism, particularly the growth of cotton, which was central to the developing textile economy in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe most frictious issue, however, was that of slavery. Since the initial European arrival in the Americas a few centuries prior, Europeans had capitalized on the trading of African slaves, which they brought to their settlements in the Americas and put to backbreaking labor under abhorrent conditions. Over time, the northern regions of the United States had phased out slavery and in several states it was completely abolished, but the southern states clung to it dearly; slave labor drove the cotton plantations and allowed the continued influx of wealth that enabled decadent southern magnates to live ostentatious and extravagant lifestyles. The tragic legacy of slavery still lives on in the United States to this day.\n\nIn 1861, shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected president, the southern states announced a secession movement, formed their own government as the Confederate States of America, and opened hostilities by attacking Union (northern) military possessions. The resulting conflict lasted until 1865 and was the bloodiest in American history, claiming around 700,000 lives and destroying much of the infrastructure in the American South. Sordid battles on both land and sea showcased the dreadful power of a fully-industrialized war machine -- a grim foreshadowing of the events to come during the 20th century. The Union was victorious and the practice of slavery was forcibly abolished, but the damage was long-lasting and healed slowly. While free, African-Americans struggled to improve their livelihoods in a system where the odds remained stacked against them, an issue compounded by the rampant xenophobia directed towards foreign immigrants who entered the United States in droves during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nAs the reunited American nation approached the turn of the 20th century, it entered a globalized world as one of the most powerful economic entities in existence. Massive population booms, urbanization, and the advent of new technology allowed unprecedented levels of growth and the harnessing of new natural resources on a grander scale. While many other nation-states adapted slowly, the United States sprung forward into a position of great prominence and, as the 20th century wore on, grew into a dominant power on the global stage.</string>
    <string _locid="160003">Like the United States, the history of Mexico begins millennia ago with the indigenous peoples who migrated to the North American continent and settled throughout, creating culturally and linguistically distinct societies. The majority of these were founded on hunter-gatherer subsistence, but some also practiced agriculture and engaged in activities such as metallurgy, nautical navigation, and long-distance trade. Notable examples include the Olmec, Maya, Toltec, and Aztec civilizations, famous for their rich material culture imprint and the impressive stone structures that they erected – sites still frequented by modern tourists.\n\nBy the 15th century, Europe was undergoing a process of social and economic revolutions marked by, among other things, massive population booms and vibrant trade economies. An allure for luxury resources brought on by the taste that they had through trade partners in the Middle East spurred a desire to explore and establish settlements so as to have direct access to these resources. After Christopher Columbus stumbled upon the Caribbean islands while seeking an alternative western route to East Asia, European settlers began to flock to the so-called “New World” seeking land, wealth, and religious freedom, among other things.\n\nThe lands comprising the modern Mexican nation were principally frequented by Spanish expeditionary soldiers, explorers, and settlers. These “conquistadors” subjugated the formidable Aztec Empire and various other indigenous inhabitants relatively quickly with their superior weaponry and diseases such as smallpox which decimated the local populations. Exploitative mercantile economies sprouted up in “New Spain”, thriving on mines and encomienda plantation systems, and funneled wealth back to their mother nation for nearly three centuries.\n\nBy the early 19th century, European colonial powers were gradually losing their grip over their possessions in the Western Hemisphere. As Enlightenment ideals electrified minds irrespective of class divisions, the inhabitants of the United States successfully revolted against their British overlords, setting an example that many of their neighbors were keen to follow. Dissatisfied with centuries of Spanish occupation, New Spain was ripe for such a movement, and the Napoleonic (French) invasion of Spain presented a terrific opportunity.\n\nIn 1810, decisive steps were taken towards independence when the priest Miguel Hidalgo and Ignacio Allende, a former military officer, rallied mobs of disgruntled peasants and commoners into a loosely-knit army and began ousting the Spanish royalist occupants of several towns on the route to Mexico City. Despite a string of successes, Hidalgo enigmatically refused to attack Mexico City, eschewing his momentum and affording the royalists precious time to react. Shortly thereafter, his disorganized army was crushed and he and Allende were executed – but the spirit of independence that his uprising had stoked would not be quelled so easily.\n\nThe movement continued under Ignacio López Rayón, José María Morelos, and Mariano Matamoros, who experienced considerably more (and prolonged) successes against the royalists owing mainly to organizational improvements. Despite some infighting which would see Rayón deposed and Morelos catapulted to primacy in the revolutionary Mexican state, the cause continued to progress. While it did experience further setbacks –  Matamoros and Morelos would be captured and executed by royalist forces –  resistance to Spanish rule continued for several years. In 1821, Augustín de Iturbide and Vicente Guerrero negotiated the Plan of Iguala, an alliance between their factions which all but cemented Mexican independence; an official proclamation would be made later that same year.\n\nSpain would unsuccessfully attempt to reconquer her former colony in 1829, but eventually conceded its independence in 1836. During this time, the fledgling nation struggled to establish a robust government and retain control of its vast territory; several of the southeastern regions in Central America seceded nearly immediately, and further problems arose when American settlers in modern-day Texas declared their independence in 1835 and upset the numerically superior Mexican army. After Texas joined the United States in 1845, another catastrophic war erupted and the Mexican forces were defeated, losing California and much of what would become the western USA in the process.\n\nIn 1855, another revolt overthrew President Antonio López de Santa Anna, causing his conservative supporters to appeal to the French for aid in the conflict. The French briefly invaded and installed Maximilian Habsburg, but American intervention led the French to abandon the conservatives, allowing the liberal revolutionaries to emerge victorious. After several more years of infighting, Porfirio Díaz, known for his role in the renowned Battle of Puebla (1862), assumed control of the Mexican state and launched a series of reform programs, ushering the nation into the modern era.</string>
    <string _locid="160010">Titu Cusi Huallpa (1468-1524, r. 1493-1524), the third Sapa Inca of the Inca Empire, was born in Cuzco to the militaristic Topa Inca Yupanqui. As a youth he experienced the dangers of court intrigue, narrowly surviving a usurpation plot spearheaded by his own tutor. As a ruler, he inherited his father’s bellicose nature, mounting ambitious and thoroughly successful campaigns to expand the Inca Empire to both the north and south. These resulted in the subjugation of vast territories in modern-day Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. Titu Cusi Huallpa was soon dubbed Huayna Capac, “The Mighty Youth”.\n \nHuayna Capac was as capable an administrator as he was a military leader: vast building and public works projects resulted in the development of a luxurious secondary capital in Quito, the founding of several cities, the construction of astronomical observatories, and improvements to the Inca agricultural system. Several massive grain silos were erected to store the burgeoning empire’s agricultural surpluses, while imposing fortresses secured Huayna Capac’s gains. As a result of his expansionist militarism and shrewd, successful administration, his subjects addressed him with two epithets that translate roughly to “Sole Ruler” and “Hearer of All People”.\n \nAmong Huayna Capac’s other achievements was the expansion of the already sophisticated Inca road network, which was critical to the economic and military vitality of his vast empire. Immense temples rose from stone, allowing the Inca people closer access to the divine. Also notable among his administrative reforms was the establishment of the qollqa system, a series of emergency supply stations that could provide the surrounding inhabitants with food in the case of famine or shortages. His motives were personal as well as benevolent; within his vast harem he fathered hundreds of children needing to be fed. Huayna Capac perished from an epidemic in 1524, leaving the Inca Empire at its zenith. His eldest son would die from the same illness, however, sparking a succession crisis that tore the massive empire apart.\n \nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Huayna Capac is as shrewd and dynamic a ruler as he was in life. He prefers a balance between economy and military, and is especially keen on quickly establishing Tambos on Native settlements and Trade Routes to speed his expansion.</string>
    <string _locid="160011">Gustavus Adolphus (1594-1632; r. 1611-1632), sixth king of the House of Vasa, was born in Stockholm to the belligerent but unsuccessful expansionist Karl IX. Ascending to the throne at age 16, Gustavus inherited a precarious situation: his father’s reigning policy had left him a relatively stable state, but one surrounded by rivals, and even Gustavus’ cousin Sigismund III challenged his right to rule. Gustavus, however, soon proved himself to be much more capable and formidable than his father, and arguably even more so than his powerful grandfather.\n\nFrom the moment that he inherited the Swedish kingdom, Gustavus demonstrated great concern for its domestic welfare. Constantly striving to improve his realm, Gustavus implemented a series of political, educational, and economic reforms. As he built his state into the polity known to posterity as the Swedish Empire, even conquered regions took keenly to his administrative rule and the prosperity that followed. He had many occasions to prove his mettle on the battlefield as well: he fought wars against Denmark, Russia, Poland, and, most famously, intervened in the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) on the side of the Protestant coalition.\n\nGustavus Adolphus was renowned as an innovator on the battlefield, revolutionizing infantry tactics and instilling in his armies an aggressive disposition and increased mobility to maximize the strength of his relatively small armies. Under his direction, the Swedish military became exceedingly versatile and employed light cannons and mobile cavalry to support his aggressive infantry maneuvers. His tactical brilliance and success on the battlefield, especially against the Catholic League during the Thirty Years’ War, caused him to be idolized by later military experts such as Carl von Clausewitz and Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1632, Gustavus Adolphus died as he lived, leading his troops in a charge during the Battle of Lützen.\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Gustavus Adolphus is the cunning and aggressive tactician that he was in life. He strives for superior military technology and likes to attack early. Gustavus prefers to engage the enemy in close combat and dominate the battlefield with artillery barrages.</string>
    <string _locid="160012">George Washington (1732-1799), the first President of the United States and the only one elected unanimously, stands tall in history as one of America’s greatest leaders. A Virginian gentleman and farmer, General Washington understood well both the sword and the plowshare. Although a common legend regarding his felling of a cherry tree is likely mere myth, Washington’s father did assure that his son received a fine education, which he leveraged into being a successful and utilitarian landowner.\n\nIn the early 1750s, Washington entered British military service as the commander of a local militia. In the years leading up to the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War, he was instrumental in the strengthening of the British position due to effective diplomacy with Haudenosaunee chiefs, swift action, and efficient leadership. Washington was greatly admired by those who served under him, and was soon promoted to general. Never one to remain on the sidelines, he led the charge into action time and time again. During the Seven Years’ War, Washington survived many battles, even having a horse shot out from under him on two occasions.\n\nWashington was an active part of the dissent that culminated in the American Revolution in the 1770s. When the Continental Congress appointed him commander in chief of the Continental Army, Washington faced the great challenge of maintaining the morale and discipline of an irregular army that was outclassed by its British adversaries on most parameters. Famously, he led a surprise attack across the Delaware River against a Hessian garrison in Trenton, winning a key victory. When his army was struggling during the bitter winter at Valley Forge, Washington, along with the French Marquis de La Fayette and the Prussian Baron von Steuben, led it through adversity and emerged with a hardened force. Washington was also known for accepting large numbers of African-Americans into his army at a time when it was deemed highly irregular.\n\nWashington was known as a modest, unambitious man who readily deferred to peers with more expertise. Soon after his victory at Yorktown, peace negotiations ended the war in 1783 and Washington, wanting no part of public political life, retired to his estate in Virginia. He was soon recalled by popular demand and was elected to the presidency in 1789, where he played an instrumental role in establishing precedents such as term limits, modest decorum, and lenient justice. In 1797, he retired for good and lived out his days at Mt. Vernon, dying in 1799.\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, George Washington is a charismatic and resourceful statesman. As leader of the land of opportunity, he uses a wide range of tactics and will not be easily outwitted. Whether through military might, raw economic output, or technological advancement, he will seize any advantage that he sees.</string>
    <string _locid="160013">Miguel Hidalgo (1753-1811) is widely considered one of Mexico’s foremost national heroes and a crucial figure in the nation’s struggle for independence. Born to a family in hacienda administration, Hidalgo received an excellent education in his youth and was then ordained into the priesthood. A noted multilinguist, his skills in various languages allowed not only fluid communication with various groups of people but also the consumption of advanced philosophical literature from the European Enlightenment movement; both would prove key in his career as a priest and revolutionary.\n\nWith passions inflamed by his reading, Hidalgo scorned the traditional regulations of the priesthood and despised the inegalitarian social order of Spanish-held Mexico. These proclivities drew the ire of the local authorities but strengthened his reputation among the common people, who admired his commitment to equality regardless of racial or social background. Hidalgo’s influence grew to the point where prospective revolutionaries sought to recruit him and leverage his clout to gain popular support. Eventually, they did.\n\nIn 1810, Hidalgo incited an insurrection among the locals in Dolores with a fiery speech that called on the populace to defend themselves and the Catholic faith against abuses from the Spanish government. Disgruntled mobs flocked to join him, swelling his ranks, which were numerous but nearly devoid of proper military training. Lack of discipline was a general problem; Hidalgo was an excellent orator and motivator, but not a skilled disciplinarian – his second-in-command Ignacio Allende was far more competent in this regard.\n\nHidalgo and Allende’s force began ousting the Spanish royalist occupants of several towns on the route to Mexico City. Despite a string of successes, Hidalgo enigmatically refused to attack Mexico City, eschewing his momentum and affording the royalists precious time to react. Shortly thereafter, his disorganized army was crushed and he and Allende were executed – but the spirit of independence that his uprising had stoked would not be quelled so easily, and a decade later Mexico would emerge as an independent nation.\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Miguel Hidalgo inspired Padre Miguel’s enlightened yet fiery personality, more revolutionary than politician. As a man familiar with both the bureaucracy and the common people, he knows how to leverage the diverse strengths of the Mexican people – whether towards early aggression or patient consolidation and shrewd advances from a strong position.</string>
    <string _locid="160020">The Priestess replaces the Healer and is unique to the Incas. It is available to the Incas starting in the Commerce Age and can be spawned by the Healers Ceremony at the Community Plaza or if The Wise Woman is chosen when advancing in age. Priestesses can commune at the Community Plaza, an action at which they are particularly effective, they can heal allied units, and they have the unique ability to convert enemy units with the exception of heroes, ships, and buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="160021">The vast Inca Empire relied not just on economic and military prowess, but also on spiritual engagement as well. Inca religion combined a complex set of ceremonial rites, animism, and solar worship, and the priestly class that presided over this system commanded immense social and political influence as curators of the people’s spiritual welfare and their relationship with the divine. The Aqllakuna, or Chosen Women, were revered virgin priestesses who were said to interact directly with the gods. Some lived a sequestered life, preparing religious rites, brewing ceremonial beer, and tending to spiritual matters, while others played a more public role, participating in religious festivals and even occasionally serving as human sacrifices. Their families, as blood relatives of the honored Aqllakuna, were also held in high esteem throughout the Inca Empire as well as in their local communities.</string>
    <string _locid="160022">The Jungle Bowman is a unique Inca archer that can be trained at the War Hut and the Stronghold starting in the Commerce Age. Jungle Bowmen are strong against infantry and are the only unit in the game to deal additional poison damage, which continues to affect enemy units shortly after they are struck by a Jungle Bowman’s arrow. This makes Jungle Bowmen particularly deadly against units attempting to flee a fight.</string>
    <string _locid="160023">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. Drawing on the resources of a vast empire, the Inca recruited warriors from numerous subordinate tribes with their own military traditions. The Ashaninka, known to the Inca as Anti, were particularly skilled archers from the rainforests of modern-day Peru. Their bowmen were adept both in stealth and in the field, firing poison-tipped shafts that made a grim end of their enemies. As battles in the Andean region tended to open with a hail of projectile weaponry before the forces closed in melee combat, Ashaninka bowmen were a valued support force.</string>
    <string _locid="160024">The Chasqui Scout is a unique Inca infantry unit available starting in the Commerce Age. It can be trained at the Town Center, the Tambo, and at the Native Embassy. Chasqui Scouts are swift units well suited to roam the map gathering intel. They can receive Home City Shipments after The Messenger is selected when advancing in age, construct Tambos, and collect Treasures. They are particularly effective against Treasure Guardians and mercenary units, and, unlike most other units, are not slowed down when receiving damage. Each time that the Incas advance in age, a Chasqui Scout will spawn at the Town Center and their build limit will increase by one.</string>
    <string _locid="160025">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. Of central importance to the Inca military were the Chasquis, scouts and messengers who could swiftly relay orders and were capable of traveling across extremely long distances as a result of their peak physical condition and the existence of an extensive network of Tambos, inns situated alongside the vast roadways of the Inca Empire. Chasquis were formidable fighters as well as messengers and scouts, however, and their keen senses, speed, and agility made them a challenge for even the most experienced troops in an enemy force.</string>
    <string _locid="160026">The Bolas Warrior is unique to the Incas and is available from the Kallanka and the Stronghold starting in the Fortress Age. It is a relatively tough infantry unit with a strong attack. As the Bolas Warrior does its damage at range, it is good to maintain this range whenever possible. Its attack has a couple of notable features: it deals area damage, affecting several units in the vicinity of where the bolas are thrown, and it slows enemy units down temporarily, preventing them from reaching their targets. Bolas Warriors are particularly effective against cavalry at range, but are vulnerable to melee attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="160027">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. They wore cloth armor that breathed well, allowed for free movement, and dissipated the force of blows. Battles tended to open with a hail of projectile weaponry before the forces closed in melee combat. One such projectile was the bolas, a relatively short-ranged weapon consisting of a pair of stone or metal weights joined by a chain or rope that entangled itself around the limbs of a target, injuring it while wrapping tightly to hamper movement. Once snared, the victim was left defenseless and vulnerable to a deadly blow.</string>
    <string _locid="160028">The Inca War Chief is an infantry unit with a high attack, a lot of hitpoints, and no range. He wields a halberd in battle, making him especially effective against enemy cavalry units. As the Inca War Chief does damage in melee combat, he is vulnerable to ranged attacks as he moves in close. The primary bonus for the Inca War Chief is that all Native warriors near him gain additional hitpoints and attack.\n \nAdditionally, he has a special attack mode, Condor Eye, that can be used once every couple of minutes to launch a javelin into enemy forces, dealing damage within a small area. Like Explorers, the War Chief has a good line of sight and can collect Treasures. The Inca War Chief can also construct Town Centers, Tambos, and Strongholds.\n \nIf a War Chief falls in a fight, he collapses and has to generate enough hitpoints to be recovered by allies. A fallen War Chief can also be returned to the Community Plaza by performing the War Ceremony.</string>
    <string _locid="160029">The indomitable ruler of the Inca Empire was the Sapa Inca, who was believed to be the son of the sun-god Inti and thus semi-divine. His function was mainly political and spiritual: he administered the maintenance and growth of the extensive Inca infrastructure system and was responsible for overseeing the efficiency of the political and economic bureaucracy, arranging the calendar, and for providing for the impoverished. As a conduit to the sun-god Inti, he also oversaw the worship of this all-important deity.\n \nHowever, the Sapa Inca had a critical military function as well: he was bound by the responsibility to expand the Inca Empire so that he might leave his successor with more than he himself had inherited. Many Sapa Incas oversaw extensive military campaigns that were carried out by their loyal generals, often their own sons. Politically, religiously, and militarily, the Sapa Inca’s absolute authority was symbolized by an extensive regalia of significant items that marked his role as the link between gods and humans. Even posthumously, the Sapa Inca retained this role and was purportedly a valuable source of information and wisdom for those visiting his tomb.</string>
    <string _locid="160030">The Plumed Spearman replaces the Pikeman and is unique to the Incas. It is available from the War Hut and the Stronghold starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Pikeman, is particularly effective against cavalry units and buildings. The Plumed Spearman costs more food than a Pikeman, but is sturdier and deals more damage as well.</string>
    <string _locid="160031">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. They wore cloth armor that breathed well, allowed for free movement, and dissipated the force of blows. Battles tended to open with a hail of projectile weaponry before the forces closed in melee combat. Inca spears were sharpened lengths of wood, hardened in fire. Their halberd had a bronze-bladed axe head opposite a hook and crowned by a stabbing point, allowing their spearmen a variety of available uses and fighting tactics.</string>
    <string _locid="160032">The Huaraca is an Inca unique unit available at the Kallanka and the Stronghold starting in the Fortress Age. It is armed with a sling and hurls incendiary stones from a long range. While effective against buildings, artillery, ships, and infantry due to their high attack and siege damage, Huaracas are extremely vulnerable to melee attacks due to their poor armor and long reloading time. When fielded in numbers, Huaracas can be particularly deadly.</string>
    <string _locid="160033">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. They wore cloth armor that breathed well, allowed for free movement, and dissipated the force of blows. Battles tended to open with a hail of projectile weaponry before the forces closed in melee combat. One such ranged weapon was the Huaraca, or sling, which was used to hurl stones with great speed and force over considerable distances. Slings were deadly in the field, their stones capable of shattering bones and causing severe internal bleeding upon impact; their ranged nature also made them an effective tool for attacking defenders while assailing fortifications.</string>
    <string _locid="160034">The Chimu Runner is a mace-wielding infantry unit that is unique to the Incas. It is available from the War Hut and the Stronghold starting in the Commerce Age. As a fast counter to archers that also excels against light infantry and artillery, Chimu Runners fill a role similar to that of Hussars. They have relatively low hitpoints but rather high attack and speed. In addition, Chimu Runners have a unique ability, during which they are not slowed down by melee attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="160035">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. Drawing on the resources of a vast empire, the Inca recruited warriors from numerous subordinate tribes with their own military traditions. The Chimu, inheritors of the ancient Moche culture, were once bitter enemies of the Inca but, once subdued, provided the Inca with some of their most formidable and loyal troops. The Chimu were known for their use of maces and clubs in warfare. Some warriors carried a mace and a small shield, charging swiftly into battle during or after the initial projectile barrage. The speed and ferocity of these light troops made them a force not to be underestimated.</string>
    <string _locid="160036">The Maceman is an Inca unique unit that is available from the Kallanka and the Stronghold starting in the Fortress Age. It can also be spawned at the Community Plaza by the Supay Ceremony. Macemen are expensive but deadly, with many hitpoints and a high attack that affects all enemy units in its path. They deal crushing blows with their two-handed maces that annihilate groups of infantry and cavalry alike and can swiftly destroy buildings, but are vulnerable to fast ranged infantry and artillery at range due to their slow speed.</string>
    <string _locid="160037">The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the Sapa Inca could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and the army, although variously specialized, was extremely well trained. Drawing on the resources of a vast empire, the Inca recruited warriors from numerous subordinate tribes with their own military traditions. The Chimu, inheritors of the ancient Moche culture, were once bitter enemies of the Inca but, once subdued, provided the Inca with some of their most formidable and loyal troops. The Chimu were known for their use of maces and clubs in warfare. Some warriors strode fearlessly into battle, carrying massive maces that required both hands to swing and decimated anything in their path. These elite shock troops posed a deadly threat to any opponent, whether in the field or in a fortification under siege.</string>
    <string _locid="160038">The Chincha Raft is a ship unique to the Incas and is available from the Dock starting in the Commerce Age. As the only Inca warship, it fills many roles and is easy to mass due to its relatively low cost. Due to their great size, Chincha Rafts are sturdier than many warships and hold a large crew, making them effective both at fishing and in battle. The crew of a Chincha Raft fires incendiary projectiles that are particularly deadly to other ships as well as land units and buildings, making them both formidable and versatile.</string>
    <string _locid="160039">The vast Inca Empire relied on a variety of means for supporting its economy and feeding its inhabitants. The vast Pacific coastline and the various lakes of the Andean region played host to productive fishing communities and bustling trade networks. Most prominent among the fishermen and naval merchants in the region were the Chincha, who were incorporated into the Inca Empire around the late 15th century. The Chincha plied the waters with large rafts that they constructed from balsa logs and fitted with sails. Capable of carrying large crews, these rafts were both productive economically and formidable in battle. Spanish explorers, upon first encountering the Chincha rafts, praised them for their sturdy and utilitarian nature.</string>
    <string _locid="160040">The Tambo replaces the Trading Post and is unique to the Incas. Just like the Trading Post, the Tambo can only be built on certain places on a given map. These places are special sites located near Native American settlements, Asian religious sites, or along Trade Routes. A War Chief, Chasqui Scout, or Villager can build the Tambo on one of these pre-placed sites. If built at a Native settlement, it establishes an alliance with the tribe there. If built near a Trade Route, it establishes a post where the passing trade unit--a Travois, Stage Coach, Rickshaw, or Train--delivers goods as it passes. The Tambo can also train Chasqui Scouts, receive Home City Shipments, and garrison Villagers for increased attack. In the Industrial Age, the Tambo can be upgraded to the Mighty Tambo, which is stronger.\n \nAllying with Natives allows a player to train special Native units, usually warriors, and also grants access to a group of improvements unique to that tribe. Native units do not cost any population spaces, but can only be built in limited numbers.\n \nBuilding a Tambo along a Trade Route is a good way to supplement resource gathering or the speed at which you may request Shipments from the Home City. Just like in the Trading Post, an improvement in the Tambo increases the speed at which the trade unit delivers goods. The route starts out serviced by a lone Travois; as you improve it, it becomes a Stage Coach and finally a Train. On Asian maps, routes begin with a one-man Rickshaw that upgrades to a Trade Cart and then a Train. [On South American maps, routes begin with a Barter Merchant that upgrades to a Llama Caravan and then a Train.]\n \nAnyone who has built a Tambo along a Trade Route is granted line of sight around the trade unit. This means that as the trade unit passes into the Fog of War or completely unexplored areas, you will be able to see what is immediately beyond the trade unit.</string>
    <string _locid="160041">The Inca Empire utilized an extensive system of roads to facilitate travel and transport throughout its vast territories. During the late 15th century, the Inca constructed over 10,000 tambos--administrative buildings that were staffed by locals conscripted through the mit’a corvee system--along these roadways. Tambos contained quipu records; they also served a military purpose, storing supplies and quartering soldiers stationed nearby or passing through the region.\n \nTambos sometimes housed Inca functionaries, or even served as economic or religious spaces. Critically, they also were transit stations for the Chasquis, messengers responsible for relaying orders and information throughout the Inca Empire. A capable Chasqui could travel from tambo to tambo within the space of a day and be assured of food and lodging for maximal efficiency. The system was deemed so effective that the Spanish conquerors adopted and expanded it.</string>
    <string _locid="160042">The Stronghold replaces the Fort and is unique to the Incas. Just like the Fort, the Stronghold is a formidable structure whose fortifications unleash heavy fire on nearby enemy objects. Since Stronghold fire is effective against enemy units and particularly deadly to ships, it is wise to attack Strongholds with units that outrange them or deal a lot of siege damage. Artillery, especially Mortars, and Monitors are excellent at leveling Strongholds.\n \nStrongholds can only be built by the Inca War Chief or by a Stronghold Travois, which can be sent from the Home City or acquired by selecting The Chief as a politician for advancing to the Industrial or the Imperial Age. The Incas can initially build only a single Stronghold, but can increase the build limit by advancing in age or through Home City Shipments. Like Forts, Inca Strongholds can train military units and be upgraded with technologies or Home City Shipments. However, they have the unique ability to garrison military units, increasing the Stronghold’s attack value.</string>
    <string _locid="160043">The Inca Empire dominated the Andean region not just through remarkable administration and military logistics, but also with a series of extensive strongholds, often situated on mountains or other strategically important locations. Combinations of stone walls, ramparts, and earthworks formed defensible positions from which the Inca could control the surrounding territory.\n \nStrongholds such as Saqsahuaman, Macchu Picchu, and Ollantaytambo played a critical role in the deadly conflict between the Spanish and the Inca, frustrating attempts by the former to conquer Inca land and the latter to retake it. Despite superior Spanish technology, the firm earthworks and stone ramparts provided a surprisingly staunch resistance against assaults, while defenders used the surrounding terrain to great effect in hampering hostile advances.</string>
    <string _locid="160044">The Kallanka is a building unique to the Incas that is available in the Fortress Age. Unlike the War Hut, it cannot attack enemy units, but it can garrison military units. Units garrisoned inside of the Kallanka do not count against the Inca player’s population limit. The Kallanka is also where the elite units of the Inca military are trained and upgraded, starting in the Fortress Age.</string>
    <string _locid="160045">Kallankas were large buildings that the Inca constructed for a variety of purposes: administrative, ceremonial, and military. They could host meetings for officials or house them, they could serve as the locations for festivals and feasts, and they could quarter and supply large numbers of soldiers.\n \nKallanka architecture, along with Kancha architecture, was widely used throughout the Inca Empire. The designs were extremely utilitarian: Kallankas were spacious enough to hold large gatherings, and they also provided natural lighting and several entrances or exits. Some were particularly massive, and even incorporated large plazas that could be used as points of assembly. They were ideal both for peacetime functions and as springboards for military campaigns.</string>
    <string _locid="160046">The Kancha House replaces the House and is unique to the Incas. Kancha Houses are necessary to support the expanding population of a growing colony. Most units that you can train take up a specific amount of population spaces or population slots. Each Kancha House or Town Center that you build raises the number of slots that you have available, allowing you to train more and more units. There is a limit on the number of Kancha Houses that you can build in a single game. Kancha Houses support more population than normal Houses, however, and also provide Inca players with a small trickle of food income, which can be improved through the Home City.\n \nEvery time that you train a unit, the game checks to see if you have enough housing to support the new soldiers or civilians. If you do not, you will not be able to train the units until you build a Kancha House or Town Center.</string>
    <string _locid="160047">Along with Kallanka architecture, Kancha architecture was widely used throughout the Inca Empire. Kanchas were groups of primarily residential, rectangular spaces generally comprising a single room, one story high, and a shared patio space. Each Kancha grouping was surrounded by an enclosure wall of stone. Some were gabled, some not, but all tended to cover their stone bases with thatched roofing, which was pitched to control the flow of rainwater. These complexes housed large numbers of people in easily defensible locations, and their organized nature lent themselves to convenient civil administration.</string>
    <string _locid="160048">Drake attacks with a multi-barrelled pistol, but will wield a sword against any foe who dares to engage him in melee combat. He has a lot of hitpoints, a special ranged attack, Grapeshot, and a special melee attack, Swashbuckler, each of which he can use once every couple of minutes. If he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Drake can collect Treasures and build Trading Posts near Native settlements and Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="160049">The eldest of twelve sons, Drake was born in 1540 in southwestern England, but moved to Kent in 1549 to avoid religious persecution. Swiftly rising from a lowly apprentice to captain of his own ship, Drake soon joined a fleet of privateers conducting raids on Portuguese and Spanish holdings in Africa and the Caribbean. During one such endeavor in 1568, Drake’s fleet was crushed by Spanish warships, forcing him to escape the enemy by swimming. A decade later, from 1577-1580, Drake circumnavigated the globe, looting several Spanish treasure ships en route, a feat for which he was knighted by Elizabeth I. After Spain declared war on England, Drake led an expedition from 1585-1586, pillaging Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, an act which prompted a Spanish invasion of England. Drake delayed this invasion by sacking the ports of La Coruna and Cadiz before crushing the Spanish Armada itself in 1588, in part due to his ingenious use of fire ships. Eight years later, he fell in a raid on Spanish Panama in 1596.</string>
    <string _locid="160050">Yermak attacks from horseback with his bulava, a deadly mace. He has a lot of hitpoints and a special melee attack, Bulava Maul, that he can use every couple of minutes. Yermak can also train brown bears to aid his forces in battle. If he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Yermak can collect Treasures and build Trading Posts near Native settlements and Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="160051">Vasiliy Timofeyevich Alenin was born on the eastern frontier of Muscovy in the mid-16th century amidst uncertain circumstances. Abandoning the life of a salt merchant for a career of river piracy, his success as a marauder on the Volga and Don earned him the name Yermak. He also gained valuable battle experience as a commander in the Livonian War of 1558-1583. In 1582, Yermak was hired by the Stroganovs, fur merchants threatened by the Tatar Khanate of Sibir. Leading a force of 840 well-equipped men, Yermak plunged into Siberia. The bows and spears of the Tatars were no match for Yermak’s muskets and cannon, and Yermak crushed the Tatars at the Battle of Chuvash Cape before seizing their capital of Qashliq. He dauntlessly continued the campaign, but overextended his forces and was slain in battle two years later in 1584. His bold, intrepid actions left a lasting legacy, prompting further Russian expansion into Siberia. Moreover, his victory at Chuvash Cape was a turning point in military history: gunpowder weaponry had ended the 2,000 year dominance of nomadic cavalry armies in the field.</string>
    <string _locid="160052">Oruc attacks with a scimitar. He has a lot of hitpoints and two special melee attacks, Crescent Swing and Lightning Kilij, each of which he can use once every couple of minutes. If he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Oruc can collect Treasures and build Trading Posts near Native settlements and Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="160053">The eldest of four brothers, Oruc was born in 1474 on the isle of Lesbos to an Ottoman Sipahi of Albanian origin. He began privateering in the Mediterranean at a young age, but was captured by the Knights of St. John, who imprisoned him in Bodrum Castle. After three years, he escaped with the help of his brother Hizir and returned to the sea. The brothers returned to the seas and made a career as corsairs raiding in the western Mediterranean. Oruc lost an arm during one such endeavor, later procuring a silver replacement. In 1516, Oruc and Hizir seized the city of Algiers from the Spanish crown and successfully defended it from a retaliatory force before turning it over to the Ottoman Empire. Oruc took Tlemcen the following year, but was soon faced with an overwhelmingly large Spanish army. He fell defending the city in 1518.</string>
    <string _locid="160054">Hizir attacks with a musket, but will wield a scimitar against any foe who dares to engage him in melee combat. He has the ability to train Barbary Corsairs as if he were a moving Saloon, and a special ranged attack, Falcon Dive, that he can use once every couple of minutes. He has a lot of hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. Hizir can collect Treasures and build Trading Posts near Native settlements and Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="160055">The third of four brothers, Hizir was born in 1478 on the isle of Lesbos to an Ottoman Sipahi of Albanian origin. In his youth, he began privateering in the Aegean Sea and rescued his elder brother, Oruc, from captivity after the latter was imprisoned by the Knights of St. John. The brothers returned to the seas and made a career as corsairs raiding in the western Mediterranean. In 1516, Oruc and Hizir seized the city of Algiers from the Spanish crown and successfully defended it from reprisals before turning it over to the Ottoman Empire. After Oruc’s death in 1517, Hizir became the Pasha of Algiers and took the honorific title Hayreddin Barbarossa “best of the faith” and “red-bearded”. Further success against various European naval powers led Suleiman the Magnificent to appoint Hayreddin Barbarossa as Grand Admiral of the Ottoman navy and governor of North Africa, Rhodes, and the Aegean isles in 1532. He retired in 1545 and died peacefully a year later.</string>
    <string _locid="160056">General Jackson attacks with a sword. He has a lot of hitpoints and a special melee attack, Rough and Tumble, that he can use once every couple of minutes. General Jackson also boosts the hitpoints of any nearby allied units. If he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. He can collect Treasures and build Trading Posts near Native settlements and Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="160057">Jackson was born in the Carolinas in 1767 and lived a youth dominated by the American Revolution. Despite his many military accomplishments, and being elected President, Jackson made some morally reprehensible decisions. Not only was he a slave owner who despicably owned over a hundred slaves at the time of his death, but he also infamously authorized the mass relocation of Native Americans from their ancestral lands under the Indian Removal Act. Today, those tragic forced removals—during which thousands of Native Peoples died—are known as The Trail of Tears.\n \nJackson had a grim childhood.  He was captured by the British at the age of thirteen and was nearly starved to death while in captivity. During this time, a Redcoat scarred him with sword slashes for refusing to clean his boots. These cruelties instilled in Jackson a lifelong hatred of the British.\n \nAfter his release, Jackson moved to Tennessee and briefly served in the American government before taking command of the local militia. During the War of 1812, Jackson commanded a force of volunteers that defeated the Creek natives and successfully repulsed a British invasion of New Orleans in 1814. A year later, he seized Florida from the Spanish. In 1818, during the First Seminole War, Jackson ordered two prisoners of war to be executed, and his conduct was investigated by Congress.\n \nJackson’s military career was matched by an equally contentious political career: he founded the Democratic Party and was elected President of the United States from 1829-1837 and was the first American president to survive an assassination attempt. During his presidency, Jackson famously stabilized the American economy and bolstered the political integrity of the nation.</string>
    <string _locid="160058">de Contrecoeur carries a spontoon when leading his troops, but will wield a sabre in combat. He has the ability to train Forest Prowlers as if he were a moving War Hut. de Contrecoeur also boosts the attack of any nearby allied units. He has a lot of hitpoints, but if he falls in a fight, he collapses and has to regenerate enough health to be recovered by allies. de Contrecoeur can collect Treasures and build Trading Posts near Native settlements and Trade Routes.</string>
    <string _locid="160059">Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrecoeur was born in 1705 in Contrecoeur, Quebec. Over the next several decades, he ascended to the rank of captain in the French military before being appointed to lead an expedition into the Ohio River valley in 1753. In 1754, he seized a British fort near modern-day Pittsburgh, renaming it Fort Duquesne after Marquis Duquesne, the Governor-General of New France. He would hold the fort against the British until his retirement from military service in 1756, receiving accolades from his peers and superiors for his shrewd conduct and effective leadership. Returning to his estate in Canada, he spent the next several years in relaxation and was elected to the Legislative Council shortly before his death in 1775.</string>
    <string _locid="160060">The Leather Cannon is a unique Swedish artillery unit that replaces the Skirmisher and is available starting in the Commerce Age. It can be trained at the Artillery Foundry. Leather Cannons are cheaper, more easily repositioned, and faster-firing than most artillery units, but have less hit points, armor, and range in comparison. They are particularly effective against infantry units, but vulnerable to artillery fire and melee attacks, especially from cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="160061">As part of a series of military reforms geared towards maximizing the tactical efficiency of his forces, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden began to employ lighter artillery during the 17th century. These leather cannons, so named for their protective outer covering, were cast in bronze. Their purpose, aside from reducing manufacturing cost, was to provide mobile support fire both before and during battles while still inflicting greater damage than an infantry musket could. Leather cannons had several key flaws, however. Their leather exterior retained heat, making the cannon harder to cool after firing and leading to irreparable warping of the barrel, and they were dangerously unreliable, often exploding in the faces of their artillery crews. The tactical utility of the weapon nevertheless heavily influenced military strategy, leading to the development of more advanced light field cannons.</string>
    <string _locid="160062">The Hakkapelit replaces the Dragoon and is unique to the Swedes. It is available at the Stable starting in the Fortress Age and classified as a Light ranged cavalry unit. They are effective at chasing down enemy cavalry and artillery. Hakkapelits use powerful cavalry firearms that have shorter range, but inflict a bit of area damage, making them effective against tight formations. Unlike the Dragoon, the Hakkapelit also sports an excellent hand attack and has access to the trample stance.</string>
    <string _locid="160063">The Hakkapelits, or Hakkapeliitta, were an elite cavalry that served Gustavus Adolphus, a Swedish king who ruled during the Thirty Years’ War. They were largely recruited from the Finnish regions of the Swedish Empire and take their name from their battle cry of “Hakkaa päälle!”, which roughly translates to "Cut them down!" but in spirit means, "Charge on!" Crying this, they were apparently so fearsome that their enemies thought that they were protected by witchcraft. Hakkapelits were very lightly armored, using their speed in the charge to quickly enter the thick of a fight, where they fought with swords and, later, small firearms. These qualities made them excellent shock troops that could break the enemy line with their charge, throwing the enemy into disarray and even potentially causing a full rout.</string>
    <string _locid="160064">The Carolean is a unique Swedish infantry unit that replaces the Musketeer and is available starting in the Commerce Age. It can be trained at the Barracks. Caroleans fire faster and are swifter in melee mode than most ranged infantry units, and their strengths can be heavily customized through the use of Home City cards. They are particularly effective against cavalry units at range and infantry units in a melee, but, like other infantry units, are vulnerable to Skirmishers and artillery.</string>
    <string _locid="160065">Under Charles XI and Charles XII, the army of the Swedish Empire underwent a series of reforms geared towards creating a more effective military to compete with neighboring rivals with greater populations and more productive land. The result of this quality-over-quantity approach was the creation of the Caroleans, an elite force known for their iconic blue and yellow uniforms. Carolean infantry were primarily musketeers, but were also equipped with a variety of additional weapons such as pikes, swords, bayonets, and even grenades. This made them exceedingly versatile military units, and, combined with their aggressive disposition, won them many victories. Although exceedingly effective and capable of overcoming numerical disadvantages, the small size of the Carolean army made it vulnerable in wars of attrition.</string>
    <string _locid="160066">The Torp is a unique Swedish building that replaces the House and is available starting in the Settlement Age. It can be constructed by Settlers. Torps are necessary to support the expanding population of a growing town. Most units that you can train take up a specific amount of population spaces or population slots. Each Torp or Town Center that you build raises the number of slots that you have available, allowing you to train more and more units. There is a limit on the number of Torps that you can build in a single game. Torps can also automatically gather from nearby resources and, through the usage of certain technologies and Home City cards, spawn certain units and resources.\n\nEvery time that you train a unit, the game checks to see if you have enough housing to support the new soldiers or civilians. If you do not, you will not be able to train the units until you build a Torp or Town Center.</string>
    <string _locid="160067">Going back to the medieval period, Scandinavian farmers commonly established farmsteads in the countryside away from settlements, seeking to make their fortune off of the land. These torps were constructed from the locally available materials: usually stone and wood, but also occasionally making use of turf roofs and siding, which insulated the structure and prevented leaking. Torps were self-sufficient and often developed over time into larger settlements and even villages. During the Swedish Empire, torps evolved into small or leased agricultural plots with their own tax obligations and even supplied men for the king’s military levy; however, as the region gradually urbanized and evolved agriculturally, their importance and productivity gradually declined.</string>
    <string _locid="160068">The Mapuche Bolas Rider is a fast ranged cavalry unit that hurls bolas at its enemies. Its attack has a couple of notable features: it deals area damage, affecting several units in the vicinity of where the bolas are thrown, and it slows enemy units down temporarily, preventing them from reaching their targets or retreating quickly. Bolas Riders inflict more damage when fighting cavalry and are effective against units in close formation. They are similar to the Bolas Warriors of the Incas and combine traits of Dragoons and Grenadiers.</string>
    <string _locid="160069">During the 16th and 17th centuries, European mounted cavalry adopted the use of firearms in imitation of a similar development among many infantry. As time went on, mounted cavalry tactics were improved by the invention of the harquebus, an early form of carbine that compromised between the accuracy of the infantry arquebus and the mobility of a pistol. However, as the 17th century progressed, cavalry were increasingly used once more in their older, familiar role as shock troops, combining the firepower of the harquebus and the force of a mounted charge. Galloping furiously into battle, bearing cuirass armor and discharging their carbines before switching to a saber for combat in close quarters, harquebusiers were a tactically versatile unit type that was deadly in a variety of situations. In England, harquebusiers often continued to prefer the pistol and saber to the carbine, and fired the former at short range before holstering it in favor of the latter.</string>
    <string _locid="160070">The General replaces the Explorer and is only available to the United States and Mexicans. It is available starting in the Exploration Age and, like the Explorer, is effective at fighting Treasure Guardians and gathering Treasures. The General also has a unique ability to use a flag to inspire nearby units and buildings to work faster and fight more effectively.</string>
    <string _locid="160071">Whether as revolutionaries, expansionists, or reunifiers, effective military figures hold a distinct status in American patriotic lore. The United States’ military was originally composed largely of local militias and men on the frontiers regularly enlisted. Able commanders achieved widespread acclaim and often political power later on; American presidents such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson, and Ulysses S. Grant all had decorated military backgrounds. These backgrounds also brought a touch of modesty that was rare among leadership figures in other nations: Washington, for example, retired from the Presidency after two terms, stressing that the station should be neither autocratic nor a life appointment.</string>
    <string _locid="160072">The Sloop replaces the Caravel and is unique to the United States. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Caravel, is an effective early warship also capable of fishing. Instead of a broadside ability, the Sloop has a charged attack that is automatically used on its first target in a battle. Sloops are faster than Caravels and have a higher attack range, but are less durable against attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="160073">During the American Revolution and the following years, the young nation faced a vast problem: it had no navy, leaving it vulnerable to sea blockades, bombardment, and piracy. Small war vessels like sloops and their cousins, cutters and schooners, formed a key part of the American navy during its early years. Vessels such as the USS Hannah, the Franklin, the Warren, the Hancock, and the Lee used their superior mobility to even the odds against formidable opponents, and still hold an esteemed place in the nautical lore of the northeast United States.</string>
    <string _locid="160074">The Steamer replaces the Galleon and is unique to the United States. Unlike the Galleon, it is available starting in the Fortress Age, not the Commerce Age, and can fish the ocean. Like the Galleon, it is a sturdy but costly ship that can train units and sustain a lot of damage. It also has the unique Full Steam ability, allowing it to increase its speed for a short period of time.</string>
    <string _locid="160075">As the nation-states of the Western Hemisphere entered a period of greater industrialization, many began to harness the force of steam power. While useful in many spheres of life, steam power revolutionized naval navigation because it lessened or outright removed the reliance of vessels on manpower, currents, or the wind. The United States made ample use of this technology, and steamboats soon traversed waterways such as the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, and the oceans in droves.</string>
    <string _locid="160076">The State Militia replaces the Crossbowman and is unique to the United States. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Crossbowman, has relatively low range and attack. However, it has considerably more hit points and becomes stronger in larger groups.</string>
    <string _locid="160077">State militias as an institution date back to before the American Revolution, when each region raised its own local militia to defend against enemy incursions and support the regular armed forces. While not as well trained, their irregular nature often lent itself well to warfare in urban areas and terrain with which they were more familiar than their adversaries. As the United States developed as a nation, volunteer militias connected to each individual state retained their role and were instrumental in both expansionist and defensive conflicts -- but somewhat less reliable in battle than well trained, regular armed forces.</string>
    <string _locid="160078">The Sharpshooter replaces the Skirmisher and is unique to the United States. It is available starting in the Fortress Age and, like the Skirmisher, is effective against a variety of units ranging from regular musket units to pistol cavalry. The Sharpshooter has higher range than the Skirmisher but lower hit points, making them effective at a distance but weak in a pitched battle.</string>
    <string _locid="160079">As firearm technology developed, long rifles enabled a new form of fighting -- one that emphasized individual accuracy over the collective power of a musket volley. The first American sharpshooters were frontiersmen and woodsmen who learned their craft out of necessity, whether through hunting to survive or fighting off enemy raids. This model is exemplified by Hawkeye, a character in several James Fenimore Cooper novels known for his accuracy with a gun at long range. As rifle manufacturing became more standardized, large units of troops could be equipped with specific weapon types, and thus arose specialized units such as the US Sharpshooters.</string>
    <string _locid="160080">The Regular replaces the Musketeer and is unique to the United States. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Musketeer, is an all-around strong soldier that is effective against cavalry. United States Regulars have a higher range than their European counterparts, however, giving them a slight edge in battle.</string>
    <string _locid="160081">As the American Revolution erupted, the Continental Congress realized the need for a regular, disciplined, and well trained army rather than a patchwork of local militias. The Continental Army was initially at a steep disadvantage when facing the British, but the leadership of influential figures such as George Washington, the Marquis de La Fayette, and Baron von Steuben helped the fledgling force evolve into a disciplined, effective military machine. From that point on, regular troops became the backbone of the American armed forces, drawing on people from all backgrounds and walks of life and bringing them together in the service of the growing nation.</string>
    <string _locid="160082">The Carbine Cavalry replaces the Dragoon and is unique to the United States. It is available starting in the Fortress Age and, like the Dragoon, is especially effective against enemy cavalry units. However, it utilizes a multi-shot carbine rifle attack and fires at a greater range than the pistols of the Dragoon.</string>
    <string _locid="160083">As early modern warfare transitioned into an age where firearms dominated the battlefield, cavalry units felt the need to adapt in kind. While long, muzzle-loading rifles could not be used effectively from horseback, a variant -- the carbine -- soon developed. Carbines were shorter and easier to reload than rifles, making them far more practical, and were adopted with enthusiasm by the US Cavalry. This weapon was far more effective than the pistols used by European dragoons and highly useful for the open terrains on which they were usually used. During the late 19th century, more advanced carbines were developed, such as Spencers and Winchesters, whose breech-loading and lever-action mechanisms allowed quick reloading and rapid firing, a deadly combination.</string>
    <string _locid="160084">The State Capitol is a building unique to the United States and is available starting in the Fortress Age. Like the Capitol, it can research various technologies; however it also has the ability to train wagons that can be used to construct various buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="160085">A capitol is a building or set of buildings that houses government offices, usually the legislative branch. Four structures have served as capitol buildings in the United States. The first was the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland. That building still stands and is currently used to house the Maryland General Assembly. The current United States Capitol is located in the capital city of Washington, D.C.</string>
    <string _locid="160086">The Meeting House is a building unique to the United States and is available starting in the Exploration Age. Unlike the Church that it replaces, its focus is on secular affairs and technologies, and it trains Surgeons instead of Priests.</string>
    <string _locid="160087">Many of North America’s European settlers were groups fleeing religious or political persecution in their European homelands. Particularly in New England, the meeting houses that they constructed initially often filled a dual role as places of worship and centers of administrative function. However, the philosophical Enlightenment greatly changed the relationship between secular and non-secular affairs, with many influential figures advocating for a full separation of Church and State. While certain fanatical religious organizations resisted this initiative, the majority of America accepted it and it became a foundational tenet of the young nation.</string>
    <string _locid="160088">The Napoleon Gun is a mercenary unit that can be trained at the Saloon or the Monastery and is available starting in the Fortress Age. Like Leather Cannons, Napoleon Guns are swifter and faster-firing than most artillery units, but have less hit points, armor, and range in comparison. They are particularly effective against infantry units, but vulnerable to melee attacks, especially from cavalry. They have an additional powerful short-range attack, the Case Shot.</string>
    <string _locid="160089">The 12-pounder Napoleon gun was named for the emperor of France, where it was developed in 1853. It quickly gained traction in the United States, where its power, versatility, and mobility were immediately noticed and used to dreadful effect; 12-pounders were some of the deadliest killing machines of the American Civil War. By the late 19th century it had superseded most field guns as the dominant model.</string>
    <string _locid="160090">The Zouave is a mercenary unit that can be trained at the Saloon or the Monastery and is available starting in the Fortress Age. Like State Militia, Zouaves have relatively low range and high hit points. However, they have more attack and none of the multipliers -- positive or negative -- that the State Militia has.</string>
    <string _locid="160091">During the 19th century, Zouaves were a light infantry force in the French army recruited primarily from their overseas territories in Africa -- an origin which their name reflects. While the units were initially indigenous, they soon drew only on European inhabitants of the occupied regions. These units grew to be held in high regard for their decorated members and success on the field, but eventually declined as they were repurposed as conscription units during the latter part of the 19th century.</string>
    <string _locid="160092">The Captured Mortar is a mercenary unit that is available to Native American civilizations starting in the Fortress Age. Like Mortars, Captured Mortars are highly effective against buildings and fortifications. However, unlike their European counterparts, Captured Mortars can also target enemy units.</string>
    <string _locid="160093">When Europeans engaged in conflict with indigenous peoples in North and South America, the adroit usage of artillery afforded them great advantages tactically and psychologically. Over time, however, native peoples such as the Inca and Mapuche acquired artillery of their own and used it to devastating effect against their European oppressors.</string>
    <string _locid="160094">As the United States expanded its territory westward during the 19th century, vast tracts of land were coveted by entrepreneurs, pastoralists, and criminals for business prospecting, cattle ranching, and the nefarious activities that a region with a minimal presence of law enforcement agents permitted. Burgeoning towns sprung up by water supplies, trade routes, arable land, and gold deposits. In this lawless world, gangs and vigilantes ruled the roost. The exploits of groups such as the Reno and Hole in the Wall Gangs and heroes (or antiheroes) such as Wyatt Earp, Butch Cassidy, and the Sundance Kid, are immortalized in the modern genre of “Western” films, capitalizing on the allure of an open, irregular climate far from the normalcy of more “civilized” urban life.\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, these figures are represented by several playable assets: buildings such as Saloons and Dance Halls, and powerful outlaw units like Gunslingers, Owlhoots, Cowboys, Comancheros, Renegados, and Pistoleros.</string>
    <string _locid="160095">Mexican law prohibits the use of certain iconographical features from their national and state flags, including historical versions, in commercial products such as video games. The Mexican flag in Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is composed of the green, white, and red tricolor background, with three eight-pointed golden stars in commemoration of the Ejército Trigarante – the Army of the Three Guarantees.</string>
    <string _locid="160096">The Chinaco replaces the Hussar and is unique to the Mexicans. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Hussar, is effective against ranged infantry but weak against heavy infantry and light cavalry. Chinacos have lower hit points than Hussars but, unlike Hussars, have multipliers on their damage output – making them more of a hard counter than a soft counter to the units against whom heavy cavalry excel. They also have a slightly longer range than other melee cavalry units, making it easier for them to attack their targets.</string>
    <string _locid="160097">During the 19th century, many Mexican military forces were irregular detachments that fought effectively despite a general lack of discipline and earned a formidable reputation. Doubling as cattle ranchers in times of peace, Chinacos were famous for their equestrian skills, martial spirit, and flamboyant attire. Respected by their peers and feared on the battlefield, these bold riders were a credit to any army they saw fit to join.</string>
    <string _locid="160098">The Soldado replaces the Musketeer and is unique to the Mexicans. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Musketeer, is effective against cavalry and shock infantry but weak against light infantry. Soldados are stronger and have a fast bayonet attack, but slower to train and take up two population slots rather than just one.</string>
    <string _locid="160099">The Viceroyalty of New Spain equipped a professional force of fighting men to defend its territories against internal and external threats alike. These Soldados proved quite effective against most opponents due to their training and organization, but could be overwhelmed by sheer numbers, as often happened during the Mexican struggle for independence. After the nation’s emancipation from Spain, the new government saw fit to continue the maintenance of a professional military force, and Soldados formed the core of many Mexican armies for years to come.</string>
    <string _locid="160100">The Salteador replaces the Skirmisher and is unique to the Mexicans. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Skirmisher, is effective against heavy infantry and light cavalry but weak against heavy cavalry. Salteadores have less range and hit points than Skirmishers, but greater damage and speed. They can enter Stealth mode, and units hit by Salteadores have their line of sight temporarily revealed.</string>
    <string _locid="160101">Initially irregular guerrilla troops during the struggle for independence, Mexican Salteadores were elevated from patriotic brigands to a legitimized paramilitary group of vigilantes. Particularly effective in settings where traditional tactics were only marginally effective, Salteadores were a powerful counterpart to the more traditional Soldados.</string>
    <string _locid="160102">The Insurgente replaces the Pikeman and is unique to the Mexicans. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and, like the Pikeman, is effective against cavalry, shock infantry, and buildings but weak against most other units. Insurgentes have lower hit points than Pikemen, but are faster and cheaper.</string>
    <string _locid="160103">When the Cry of Dolores incited an insurrection in 1810, touching off the movement towards Mexican independence, many supporters were peasants and indigenous natives armed with little more than farm tools or other rudimentary weapons. These Insurgentes were no match for a disciplined military force, but their sheer numbers could be leveraged into unexpected victories.</string>
    <string _locid="160104">The Padre replaces the Priest and is unique to the Mexicans. It is available starting in the Exploration Age and, like the Priest, can heal allied units. It also can use the Pacify ability to slow down enemy units’ attack and movement speeds, and can be upgraded via several technologies at the Cathedral.</string>
    <string _locid="160105">Padre, meaning “Father”, was the typical title of many clergymen in New Spain – the lands which would later become Mexico, the American Southwest, and several Latin American states. In a society where staunch adherence to the Catholic faith was paramount, Padres exercised great influence among the local people as they fulfilled their duties as intermediaries between God and his human worshippers. One priest, Miguel Hidalgo, was so popular among the local people that he managed to incite an insurrection against the Spanish royalist government.</string>
    <string _locid="160106">The Cathedral replaces the Church and is unique to the Mexicans. It is available in the Exploration Age, can repair nearby buildings, and can research a series of special technologies, many of which are double-edged swords or can only be obtained under certain conditions. Cathedrals also train the Padre, a unique healer for the Mexicans.</string>
    <string _locid="160107">In Christian states, the Cathedral was the ultimate monument to the glory of God. A large building of worship that was usually the seat of a bishop, one could only be painstakingly erected through extensive financial support and labor. Centers of religious influence both in the past and present, these structures stand to posterity as imposing and impressive reminders of the architectural prowess of past societies.</string>
    <string _locid="160108">The Hacienda is available starting in the Exploration Age and is unique to the Mexicans. Uniquely, it combines the abilities of three buildings: the Mill, the Estate, and the Livestock Pen. It can be toggled to produce food, coin, livestock animals, or even economic and military units while economic units are working on it. Like other economic buildings, Haciendas are costly but crucial to a Mexican player’s economy as the game goes on.</string>
    <string _locid="160109">As the Spanish settled Central America and established a mercantile economy based on the encomienda system, Haciendas – large estates – became crucial to the system’s functionality. These estates were initially colonial strongholds rich in the production of agricultural and other resources, but after the Mexican independence movement became crucial components of the new nation’s largely agrarian economy. Although they contributed to the economic development of the young nation, Haciendas also served as a constant reminder of the social divisions and inequities that the independence movement had only partially succeeded in eradicating.</string>

    <string _locid="162007">Ethiopians</string>
    <string _locid="162008">While the recorded history of Ethiopia goes back several millennia, the region’s early modern history opens with a tumultuous conflict known to posterity as the Ethiopian-Adal War (1529-1543). The ruling Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia struggled initially against the Adal forces of the intrepid Ahmad Gragn, whose deft use of Ottoman artillery gained him the upper hand in several battles. The Adal occupation lasted over a decade, but the Solomonic dynasty, led by the tenacious Queen Sabla Wengel and the formerly exiled Emperor Gelawdewos, eventually threw off the foreign yoke and defeated Gragn. Instrumental in this victory were the tattered remnants of a Portuguese expeditionary force led by Cristovao da Gama, who perished in the process. Gelawdewos then sought to turn the tables and invade Adal, but suffered the same fate as the overconfident Gragn and was slain in turn in 1559.		\n\nNext to attempt to subjugate the resurgent Ethiopian state was the Ottoman Empire, which seized several key locations on the coast but was unable to push further inland. Further threats ensued from a new power: the Harar Sultanate, which had assumed control of the lands ruled by the crumbling Adal Sultanate. Although these were parried successfully, constant conflict and climatic conditions culminated in unstable conditions that caused a series of mass migrations of East African people-groups into the Ethiopian sphere of influence. Most notable among these were the Oromo, hardy pastoralists and fierce warriors who would attain immense power within the fragmenting Ethiopian state and retain it for centuries.		\n\nBy the late 17th century, Ethiopia had devolved into a patchwork of loosely knit localist entities that could only barely be said to answer to the imperial mantle. This all changed during the reign of Iyasu the Great (r. 1682-1706), who inaugurated a long programme of reforms across various spheres from political centralization to infrastructure, cultural growth, and foreign diplomacy. His untimely death, however, sent the recovering state into a tailspin. The resulting power vacuum was filled by a series of competing clans and princes, who by five decades later had reduced a once-powerful state into little more than an anarchical patchwork of feudal demesnes where ruthless warlords ruled by force. This so-called Era of the Princes lasted nearly a century.		\n\nIn 1855, Kassa Hailu, a shifta (brigand) turned magnate, triumphed over his rival warlords and was crowned Emperor Tewodros II. Desperate to modernize his fledgling nation, Tewodros resorted to the shocking decision to kidnap European officials and missionaries and barter them for help from European powers in industrializing Ethiopia. This scheme backfired violently, as the British responded with a full-scale invasion, annihilated Tewodros’ armies with ease, and rescued the hostages, leaving Ethiopia once more in a volatile situation. Despite this setback, the Ethiopian state recovered quickly. After the so-called Scramble for Africa commenced during the following decades, Ethiopia was notable as one of the few regions on the African continent that eluded the talons of European imperial colonialism.</string>
    <string _locid="162009">Tewodros</string>
    <string _locid="162010">Born in 1818, Kassa Hailu spent his youth avoiding death and misfortune in the war-torn land of Ethiopia, a place plagued by internecine conflicts between various princes and warlords vying for the imperial title. After a brief stint in a local army, Kassa turned to banditry, becoming a shifta (brigand). Building an increasingly large following of people who saw him as a liberator and restorer of wealth to the common people whom the squabbling warlords had bled dry, Kassa eventually was elevated to the noble class in 1845.		\n\nRefusing to submit to imperial authority, he continued on his prior path as an autonomous magnate, but now with the power of a title and land behind him. Realizing the threat that he posed, the other warlords joined forces to oppose Kassa, but his success on the battlefield continued. Kassa went on to crush various warlords and imperial armies, even invading Ottoman Egypt on one occasion. His campaigns culminated in triumph in 1855, when he was invested with the imperial title and took the name Tewodros II.		\n\nDesperate to modernize his fledgling nation, and perhaps hubristic after a long string of military triumphs, Tewodros resorted to the shocking decision to kidnap European officials and missionaries and barter them for help from European powers in industrializing Ethiopia. This scheme backfired violently, as the British responded with a full-scale invasion, annihilated Tewodros’ armies with ease, and rescued the hostages, leading Tewodros to commit suicide in 1868.		\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Tewodros is the daring and impetuous leader that he was in reality. Having known what it means to nearly lose everything and then work his way to the pinnacle of power, he is not afraid to act decisively and take risks to secure victory. Whether it be through swift aggression or savvy battlefield maneuvers, Tewodros will triumph at any cost.</string>
    <string _locid="162011">Hausa</string>
    <string _locid="162012">The Hausa are a people-group inhabiting the Sahelian region of modern-day Nigeria, a region that rose to immense prominence by the early modern period owing primarily to its location on the lucrative trans-Saharan trade routes. A mix of sedentary and pastoral-nomadic societies, the Hausa coalesced into a series of kingdoms during this time, such as Kano and Zazzau. As Islam spread to the region thanks to merchants from north of the Sahara, it took hold on vast numbers of people, from commoners to rulers. One such ruler, Muhammad Rumfa (r. 1463-1499), converted most of Kano to Islam, planting a seed that would bear fruit centuries later.		\n\nAnother ruler, Queen Amina of Zazzau (r. 1576-1610), is credited with building the first Islamicized Hausa kingdom. Her achievements were manifold, ranging from military expansion to city building and the reform of agricultural infrastructure. Like several other polities of the time, Zazzau had to contend with the frictious relationship between agriculturalists and pastoralists. While the former derived wealth and power from produce and urban consolidation, the latter measured wealth in mobile, utile materialism such as horses and cattle. Peaceful interaction between the groups was mutually beneficial, but predatory nomadism occasionally ensued and posed a major threat to both societies. To address this issue, Amina commissioned the construction of a series of fortifications around all major urban centers in her kingdom.		\n\nBy the turn of the 19th century, the Hausa polities were in turmoil. Exploited peasants banded with Fula pastoralists to resist the oppressive policies of Hausa city-states such as Gobir. They found a leader in Usman dan Fodio, a Fulani scholar and military leader. After several decades as a religious teacher, Usman organized an insurrection in 1802 that sought to reform his community – which he felt had strayed from a virtuous path and given itself over to greed, immorality, and cruelty – through Islamic teachings. Leading armies primarily of Fulani as Commander of the Faithful, he dismantled the existing Hausa system and established the Sokoto Caliphate in 1803. Before his death in 1817, Usman authored countless treatises on political, cultural, social, and religious matters.		\n\nOver the next several decades, the Sokoto Caliphate expanded swiftly, establishing dominance over the nearby city-states and consolidating its power through control of vital trade, the construction of a network of fortresses, and a sophisticated taxation system. Despite these strengths and a robust military, the Caliphate was no match for the repeated incursions of fully industrialized European imperial powers during the turn of the 20th century, and it swiftly crumbled, allowing the British and Germans to partition its former territory.</string>
    <string _locid="162013">Queen Amina</string>
    <string _locid="162014">Queen Amina of Zazzau (r. 1576-1610), was raised in the royal court of Zazzau, a fledgling Hausa kingdom in modern-day Nigeria. From an early age she displayed an affinity for warfare, and became an officer in the kingdom’s cavalry forces – a position quite unusual for a female to hold at the time. Amina continued in this position after her brother assumed the rule of the kingdom, but then inherited the throne herself after his death in 1576 – and would hold it until her own death in 1610.		\n\nAs a ruler, Amina left a multifaceted legacy. Her achievements were manifold, ranging from martial prowess to city building and the reform of agricultural infrastructure. She is credited with building the first Islamicized Hausa kingdom. Over the course of more than three decades, Amina constantly led her forces on successful military campaigns to expand Zazzau and consolidate its territory. Furthermore, it is said that the rights and agency of women in the region increased considerably during Amina’s reign.		\n\nLike several other polities of the time, Zazzau had to contend with the frictious relationship between agriculturalists and pastoralists. While the former derived wealth and power from produce and urban consolidation, the latter measured wealth in mobile, utile materialism such as horses and cattle. Peaceful interaction between the groups was mutually beneficial, but predatory nomadism occasionally ensued and posed a major threat to both societies. To address this issue, Amina commissioned the construction of a series of fortifications around all major urban centers in her kingdom.		\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Amina is the shrewd, charismatic, and resourceful leader that she was in reality. Knowing that there is always more than one path to triumph, she will utilize the versatile skill sets and array of strategies that made her such an effective ruler in real life. Whether it be through the construction of strong fortifications to protect a robust economy, or with deft use of aggressive cavalry maneuvers and raids, Amina will bring the full might of the Hausa people to bear against her enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="162015">Palace</string>
    <string _locid="162016">The Palace replaces the Fort and is unique to African civilizations. It is available in the Commerce Age, can train various units including cannons and mercenaries, and can serve as a Home City shipment arrival point.</string>
    <string _locid="162017">A quintessential symbol of royal power, a palace served as a residence, a fortification, and a site where diplomacy would be conducted. Palaces allowed their residents to exert considerable influence into the surrounding region, and in many instances rulers deemed it prudent to establish several throughout their domain, allowing them to shift their focus to where it was needed most.</string>
    <string _locid="162018">War Camp</string>
    <string _locid="162019">The War Camp is a unique African military production building. It is available in the Commerce Age, and can train both infantry and cavalry units.</string>
    <string _locid="162020">Societies across the vast African continent employed a diverse array of military unit types varying by culture, resources, and often most crucially, climate. While some biomes were inhospitable to horses, for example, mounts were indispensable in regions such as North Africa and the Sahara that were dominated by plains and deserts. Military forces established camps for quartering, organizing, and training new recruits in the fashion that best suited their region.</string>
    <string _locid="162021">Watch Tower</string>
    <string _locid="162022">The Watch Tower is a unique African fortification. It is available in the Exploration Age, and, like the Outpost, can fire on enemy units and ships and receive Home City shipments. It is also able to train Outlaw units, and its line of sight can be increased by upgrades.</string>
    <string _locid="162023">Coastal regions in Africa boasted especially sophisticated tower and fortification architecture, but many other regions had formidable outposts of their own around which settlements were built. These settlements attracted travelers, merchants, and mercenaries who variously brought intrigue, power, and vibrancy wherever they went.</string>
    <string _locid="162024">Port</string>
    <string _locid="162025">The Port is a unique African naval building. It is available in the Exploration Age, and, like the Dock, can train economic vessels, standard warships, and mercenary warships: the Xebec for the Hausa; and the War Dhow for the Ethiopians.</string>
    <string _locid="162026">Long before the early modern period, Africa’s coasts were bustling hubs for vibrant international trade and commerce. North African ports date back to the Egyptian and Phoenician-Carthaginian civilizations of antiquity, while others, such as Berbera, Elmina, and Mombasa rose to prominence during the medieval period and onwards. Still others played a role in networks spanning the vast rivers that run throughout the African continent.</string>
    <string _locid="162027">Granary</string>
    <string _locid="162028">The Granary is a unique African economic building. It is available in the Exploration Age and boosts the food gathering rate of all nearby Villagers. While inexpensive, it also takes a long time to construct.</string>
    <string _locid="162029">While much of the African continent is incredibly fertile, in many regions the climate conditions – particularly dry heat and humidity – variously make food easily perishable or the subject of fierce competition. Many civilizations erected granaries to store their surplus food and protect it from the climate and raiders alike. A surplus was crucial, as it could be drawn on as a recourse in times of famine and food shortages.</string>
    <string _locid="162030">Field</string>
    <string _locid="162031">The Field is a unique African economic building. It is available in the Exploration Age and serves as a location from which Villagers can infinitely but slowly gather either food or coin.</string>
    <string _locid="162032">Like in several other parts of the world, agriculture was a staple of societies in many regions in Africa. Crops can fundamentally be divided into two categories: alimentary and non-alimentary. The former, prime examples of which in Africa include teff and millet, were grown to be eaten. The latter saw primary use for material and commercial purposes, with examples such as indigo (for dye) and coffee (technically also a consumable, but with primarily commercial value).</string>
    <string _locid="162033">University</string>
    <string _locid="162034">The University is a unique Hausa building. It is available in the Exploration Age and provides a trickle of Influence or Experience. That rate increases when it is near Town Centers, Palaces, and Trading Posts. It can also research special technologies for varying Influence costs.</string>
    <string _locid="162035">An often overlooked feature of medieval and early modern societies in West Africa is their rich tradition of storytelling and education. The griot, a keeper of oral tradition responsible for entertaining and educating his people with tales and epics, was a key figure among several rural and nomadic groups. Other urban societies established universities in the midst of their cities to educate future scholars in religious and secular subjects.</string>
    <string _locid="162036">Mountain Monastery</string>
    <string _locid="162037">The Mountain Monastery is a unique Ethiopian building. It is available in the Exploration Age and can be placed atop mines to gather both coin and Influence. While Mountain Monasteries generate resources slowly on their own, Villagers and especially Abuns vastly increase that rate when tasked to them. Mountain Monasteries can also research several technologies.</string>
    <string _locid="162038">Heirs to earlier ascetic traditions, East African monasteries were often situated in remote locations such as the flat-topped mountains, or amba, occurring in the region. A prominent example of these is Debre Damo in Tigray, but there was also another type, the rock-hewn church, exemplified in Lalibela. As European contact with East African societies increased, European architectural techniques also influenced African churches.</string>
    <string _locid="162039">Livestock Market</string>
    <string _locid="162040">The Livestock Market is a unique African building that is best thought of as a combination of the Market and the Livestock Pen. It is available in the Exploration Age, can produce livestock, and can upgrade Villagers and livestock. Additionally, resources can be sold and bought at the Livestock Pen, and livestock tasked to it can be sold for wood or coin.</string>
    <string _locid="162041">Like for several other world societies, livestock played a crucial role among several African people-groups – sedentary and pastoral-nomadic – both as a source of food and as a symbol of wealth. As such, livestock markets were prime loci of economic commercial transactions, whether they were within a society, with foreign merchants, or as a bridge between sedentary and pastoral-nomadic groups.</string>
    <string _locid="162042">Hut</string>
    <string _locid="162043">The Hut is a unique African building that replaces the House and is available in the Exploration Age. Huts can produce Levies, swift units whose hit points deteriorate over time, making them useful for last-resort defenses but unreliable for sustained offensives.</string>
    <string _locid="162044">Among larger African societies, the majority of military forces were levies organized within individual villages in a pseudo-feudal system. The Hut’s ability to call levies represents that system and reflects the reality that, while numerous, levies were not necessarily the most effective troops on an individual basis.</string>
    <string _locid="162045">Sultan Mohammed II</string>
    <string _locid="162046">Sultan Mohammed II is an antagonist in ‘Battle of the Three Kings’, a Historical Battle featuring the Moroccans.</string>
    <string _locid="162047">Little is known of Mohammed II of the Saadi dynasty in modern-day Morocco. After assuming the throne in 1574, he conducted a purge of his immediate family members that made him vastly unpopular. Things went from bad to worse when his uncle, Abd al-Malik, returned from exile in 1576 with an Ottoman army and made short work of his rival in a series of decisive battles. Reeling from these defeats, Mohammed II enlisted the aid of the Portuguese, who had their own designs in the region. Their combined army met Abd al-Malik’s force at Alcacer Quibir in 1578 and was handily defeated, losing his own life in the process.</string>
    <string _locid="162048">Sultan Abd al-Malik</string>
    <string _locid="162049">Sultan Abd al-Malik is a protagonist in ‘Battle of the Three Kings’, a Historical Battle featuring the Moroccans.</string>
    <string _locid="162050">Born to a Saadi sultan, Abd al-Malik’s early life was anything but comfortable. After his father was eliminated by Ottoman agents, he was left at the mercy of his bloodthirsty brother, a man who insisted on securing power by executing his siblings. Narrowly escaping this fate, Abd al-Malik fled to Ottoman territory in modern-day Algeria, where he bided his time, immersing himself in the Ottoman world and making several important contacts. When the ineffectual Mohammed II seized power in Morocco in 1574, Abd al-Malik saw his chance and returned to his homeland with an Ottoman army. After drubbing his rival in several battles, Abd al-Malik won a decisive victory at Alcacer Quibir in 1578, but perished of illness in the process.</string>
    <string _locid="162051">Usman dan Fodio</string>
    <string _locid="162052">Usman dan Fodio is the main protagonist in ‘Fall of the Hausa’, a Historical Battle featuring the Hausa. Usman attacks with a rifle, deals bonus damage against Treasure Guardians, and has a special attack, Sharpshooter, which can be used against Treasure Guardians. Usman can also train Fula Warriors, build Trading Posts, and see stealth units.</string>
    <string _locid="162053">A Fulani scholar and military leader, Usman dan Fodio was born in 1754 in Gobir, one of the Hausa city-states of modern Nigeria. After several decades as a religious teacher, Usman organized an insurrection in 1802 that sought to reform his community – which he felt had strayed from a virtuous path and given itself over to greed, immorality, and cruelty – through Islamic teachings. Leading armies primarily of Fulani as Commander of the Faithful, he dismantled the existing Hausa system and established the Sokoto Caliphate in 1803. Before his death in 1817, Usman authored countless treatises on political, cultural, social, and religious matters.</string>
    <string _locid="162054">Ahmad al-Mansur</string>
    <string _locid="162055">Ahmad al-Mansur is a protagonist in ‘Battle of the Three Kings’, a Historical Battle featuring the Moroccans. al-Mansur is a heavy cavalry unit who can use the Saharan Wind ability to speed the movement of nearby allied units. He can also build Trading Posts and see stealth units.</string>
    <string _locid="162056">A brother of Abd al-Malik, Ahmad al-Mansur experienced a similarly tumultuous childhood thanks to the villainy of his relatives in power. Narrowly escaping execution, Ahmad al-Mansur fled with his brother to Ottoman territory in modern-day Algeria, where he immersed himself in the Ottoman world and made several important contacts. When the ineffectual Mohammed II seized power in Morocco in 1574, Abd al-Malik and Ahmad al-Mansur returned to their homeland with an Ottoman army, handily defeating Sultan Mohammed II in several battles. Their crowning victory at Alcacer Quibir in 1578 eliminated their rival and his Portuguese allies, but Abd al-Malik perished of illness. The throne fell to Ahmad al-Mansur, who ruled Morocco for another 35 years before dying of the plague in 1603.</string>
    <string _locid="162057">Kassa Hailu</string>
    <string _locid="162058">Kassa Hailu is a protagonist in ‘Era of the Princes’, a Historical Battle featuring the Ethiopians. He attacks with a shield and spear, has an attack against Treasure Guardians, and has a passive ability, Dodge, which gives him a chance to evade enemy attacks. His Roar of the Lion ability increases the attack speed of nearby allied units, and he can build Trading Posts and see stealth units.</string>
    <string _locid="162059">Born in 1818, Kassa Hailu spent his youth avoiding death and misfortune in the war-torn land of Ethiopia, a place plagued by internecine conflicts between various princes and warlords vying for the imperial title. After a brief stint in a local army, Kassa turned to banditry, becoming a shifta (brigand). Building an increasingly large following of people who saw him as a liberator and restorer of wealth to the common people whom the squabbling warlords had bled dry, Kassa eventually was elevated to the noble class in 1845. Refusing to submit to imperial authority, he crushed various warlords and imperial armies, even invading Ottoman Egypt on one occasion. His campaigns culminated in triumph in 1855, when he was invested with the imperial title – which he would hold until his death in 1868 – and took the name Tewodros II.</string>
    <string _locid="162060">Akan Kingdoms</string>
    <string _locid="162061">The Akan (meaning “enlightened”) are an indigenous people of West Africa. Inhabiting a region fruitful in both produce and gold, they enjoyed immense wealth throughout the late medieval and early modern periods. For all its benefits, this opulence attracted the avarice of European explorers and adventurers, particularly the Portuguese, British, and Dutch.		\n\nA complicated dynamic ensued: the power and wealth of the Akan fueled generally effective resistance to Europeans who sought to encroach on their homelands and subjugate them, but it was just as often leveraged to actively participate in the trans-Atlantic slave trade through the capturing, buying, and selling of slaves. Although the British eventually subjugated the Akan in the early 20th century, this dominion was only very temporary, and the Akan nations regained independence several decades later.</string>
    <string _locid="162062">Berber Sultanates</string>
    <string _locid="162063">The Berbers, or Amazigh (meaning “free people”) are among the indigenous inhabitants of much of North and Northwest Africa. These diverse regions gave rise to several ways of life: some Amazigh were sedentary agriculturalists or urban residents, while many others were pastoralists. All enjoyed the benefits of living near or on the vibrant trade routes spanning the northern part of the African continent.		\n\nBy the early modern period, the Ottoman Empire controlled most of the core Amazigh lands either directly or through client kingdoms. The most notable exception was the Saadi Sultanate (1510-1659) in modern-day Morocco, which used a modernized army and shrewd diplomacy to maintain its independence, even defeating a large Portuguese invasion force at Alcacer Quibir in 1578. After their eventual collapse in the 17th century, the Saadis were replaced by the Alaouites, who despite periods of Spanish and French dominion still rule the region today.</string>
    <string _locid="162064">Somali Sultanates</string>
    <string _locid="162065">The Somalis (etymology uncertain) are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Horn of East Africa, which juts out between the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. During the early modern period, the region was ruled by a series of sultanates, all of which derived their power from two principal usages of water: land irrigation and maritime trade. While the arid climate on the mainland made a consistent water supply crucial for agriculture and sustenance, the nearby seas played host to some of the most lively trade networks in world history. The port of Berbera, for example, was a crucial conduit of supplies to and from the mainland.		\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Adal and Ajuran Sultanates in the 16th and 17th centuries, the region fragmented into several minor kingdoms, such as Bari, Girad, and Majeerteen. Their rule was abruptly interrupted by the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which saw the British and Italians in particular attempt to impress their rule on the Somali people. Although resistance was carried out in spurts by groups such as the Darawiish (Dervishes), it would not be until 1969 that the Somali people finally regained independence.</string>
    <string _locid="162066">Sudanese Sultanates</string>
    <string _locid="162067">The Sudanese are a large collection of people-groups – the most numerous of which are Sudanese Arabs – indigenous to modern-day Sudan. During the early modern period, this region was ruled primarily by two sultanates: Darfur (17th-20th centuries) and Sennar (16th-19th centuries). Both of these profited immensely off the bustling trade networks running along the Nile and its tributaries as well as – infamously – the slave trade running along them.		\n\nAs the centuries rolled on, Sudanese independence was threatened from several directions. The Ottomans expanded along the Nile from the north, while the Ethiopians campaigned from the east. The early 19th century saw the Ottomans briefly occupying many Sudanese lands, dismantling the Sennar Sultanate and subjugating the Darfur Sultanate. The British then occupied Sudan during the First World War in 1916, ending Ottoman rule. Four decades later, Sudan attained independence in 1956.</string>
    <string _locid="162068">Yoruba Kingdoms</string>
    <string _locid="162069">The Yoruba are a people-group indigenous to West Africa, especially modern-day Nigeria. Their homeland combines vast coasts, powerful rivers, fertile lands, thick jungles, and vast savannahs. As such, the Yoruba developed several means of subsistence, but by the early modern period they were primarily sedentary. Remarkably large and bustling urban centers developed and served as foci of local and royal power.		\n\nDuring the 17th-19th centuries, the Oyo Empire held sway over much of the region and exerted pressure on its neighbors in Benin and Dahomey. While the state benefited economically from trade with European merchants, its military, overconfident in its powerful forces of cavalry and infantry, delayed its widespread adoption of firearms until the 19th century. This, combined with civil unrest, made it susceptible to aggression from the rising Sokoto Caliphate. These Fulani invasions in turn opened the door for British invasions to easily overwhelm the region and hold it until 1960, when the Nigerian nation gained its independence.</string>
    <string _locid="162070">Resource - Influence</string>
    <string _locid="162071">In Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Influence represents the intangible currency by which political leaders and systems can persuade others to help them achieve their goals. Unique to African civilizations, Influence can be spent to acquire various special units and technologies. It can be generated primarily through three methods. The first is through a default automatic trickle; the second is by fattening and keeping cattle at Livestock Markets; and the third is through a unique means for each African civilization: the Hausa build Universities, while the Ethiopians build Mountain Monasteries.</string>
    <string _locid="162072">Princes</string>
    <string _locid="162073">Princes replace Explorers and are unique to African civilizations. Like Explorers, they can collect Treasures, construct certain buildings, and are effective against Treasure Guardians. They also have two unique abilities. The first, Chaos, causes Treasure Guardians to attack each other. The second, Fealty Aura, causes the fighting abilities of Princes to increase when surrounded by larger numbers of allied units.		\n\nEthiopian and Hausa kingdoms often tended to be united more through cultural commonalities than through political centralization. Princes could inherit their position through familial lineage, but also did so by gathering followers and attaining a large amount of influence among the local population, which was necessary to retain even an inherited position regardless. Political maneuvering was just as often linked to opportunism and manipulation of volatile situations as it was to building one’s power base.</string>
    <string _locid="162075">Charged Actions</string>
    <string _locid="162076">In Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, some units’ special abilities are not manually activated by the player, but rather automatically activate once they have recharged.</string>
    <string _locid="162077">Fealty Aura</string>
    <string _locid="162078">While some special units have auras that affect nearby allied units, the Fealty Aura is the opposite. Unique to African heroes, this ability increases the fighting abilities of heroes themselves depending on the number of allied units nearby.</string>
    <string _locid="162079">African Kingdoms</string>
    <string _locid="162080">Representing larger realms rather than individual people-groups, African Kingdoms are similar to Native American Settlements and Asian Holy Sites, but provide more units and technologies than their counterparts. African civilizations also have special benefits, such as certain free upgrades, as well as enhanced access through their unique Alliances aging-up mechanic.</string>
    <string _locid="162081">Alliances</string>
    <string _locid="162082">Whereas some civilizations advance through the Ages by selecting politicians, constructing wonders, or annexing federal territories, African civilizations do so by forming alliances with various groups, reflecting the complex process by which political authority and legitimacy was derived in many African societies. Each Alliance enables a package of various units and technologies distributed throughout relevant buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="162083">Ras</string>
    <string _locid="162084">The Ras replaces the Explorer and is unique to the Ethiopians. The Ras can collect Treasures, construct Trading Posts, Town Centers, and Palaces, and is effective against Treasure Guardians. The Ras attacks from horseback with a musket and has two unique abilities. The first, Chaos, causes Treasure Guardians to attack each other. The second, Fealty Aura, causes the fighting abilities of Rases to increase when surrounded by larger numbers of allied units.</string>
    <string _locid="162085">Ethiopian and Hausa kingdoms often tended to be united more through cultural commonalities than through political centralization. The Ras, an Ethiopian prince, could inherit his position through familial lineage, but also did so by gathering followers and attaining a large amount of influence among the local population, which was necessary to retain even an inherited position regardless. Political maneuvering was just as often linked to opportunism and manipulation of volatile situations as it was to building one’s power base.</string>
    <string _locid="162086">Emir</string>
    <string _locid="162087">The Emir replaces the Explorer and is unique to the Hausa. The Emir can collect Treasures, construct Trading Posts, Town Centers, Palaces, and Universities, and is effective against Treasure Guardians. The Emir rides a camel, attacks with a pistol, and has two unique abilities. The first, Chaos, causes Treasure Guardians to attack each other. The second, Fealty Aura, causes the fighting abilities of Emirs to increase when surrounded by larger numbers of allied units.</string>
    <string _locid="162088">Ethiopian and Hausa kingdoms often tended to be united more through cultural commonalities than through political centralization. The Emir, a Hausa prince, could inherit his position through familial lineage, but also did so by gathering followers and attaining a large amount of influence among the local population, which was necessary to retain even an inherited position regardless. Political maneuvering was just as often linked to opportunism and manipulation of volatile situations as it was to building one’s power base.</string>
    <string _locid="162089">Shotel Warrior</string>
    <string _locid="162090">The Shotel Warrior is a unique Ethiopian fast shock infantry unit. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and is effective against ranged infantry but weak against heavy infantry and light cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162091">Shotels are deadly blades whose unique curvature reflects their original derivation from agricultural tools. Unique to East Africa and with a heritage dating back to the medieval Ethiopian kingdoms, shotels retained relevance as multipurpose weapons whose distinct shape permitted them to slash as well as circumvent obstacles to inflict unexpected puncture wounds.</string>
    <string _locid="162092">Abun</string>
    <string _locid="162093">The Abun is a unique Ethiopian priest. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and can heal units at range as well as empower buildings to work more efficiently.</string>
    <string _locid="162094">The abun, an Ethiopian term for bishop, is an office dating back to Late Antiquity and a testament to Ethiopia’s legacy as one of the world’s first Christian states. As time went on, the number of external religious influences increased in the forms of interaction with Islamic states and Catholic missionaries, but abuns retained a key role in several societies.</string>
    <string _locid="162095">Gascenya</string>
    <string _locid="162096">The Gascenya is a unique Ethiopian heavy infantry unit armed with a throwing javelin. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and is effective at range but especially strong against cavalry in a melee.</string>
    <string _locid="162097">While Ethiopian armies gradually began to incorporate firearms after they came into contact with European powers and the Ottoman Empire, the vast majority of troops were armed with basic weapons such as spears and shields. Despite their technological disadvantage, these soldiers were numerous, hardy, and formidable on the battlefield.</string>
    <string _locid="162098">Javelin Rider</string>
    <string _locid="162099">The Javelin Rider is a ranged cavalry unit armed with a throwing javelin. It is available starting in the Commerce Age for African civilizations and is particularly effective against other cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162100">For much of the medieval and early modern periods, the dominant style of mounted warfare in East Africa involved mobile light cavalry armed with javelins or other multipurpose weapons. Mounted javelineers’ versatility allowed them the choice of fighting from range or engaging in a melee depending on the situation.</string>
    <string _locid="162101">Oromo Warrior</string>
    <string _locid="162102">The Oromo Warrior is an unique Ethiopian heavy cavalry unit available starting from the Fortress Age in the War Camp. This hand cavalry unit can attack targets quickly with its swift Shotel blade. It also has access to a powerful charged musket attack that recharges over time and allows Oromo Warriors to fire a volley before transitioning into hand combat.</string>
    <string _locid="162103">The early modern period saw a series of migrations of large people-groups into modern-day Ethiopia. One of these, the Oromo, became increasingly influential and numerous, to the point where they comprised the largest demographic group in the region. Famed for their bravery and martial prowess, the Oromo were valuable allies – and even more dangerous enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="162104">Neftenya</string>
    <string _locid="162105">The Neftenya is a unique Ethiopian light infantry unit armed with a rifle and a shield. It is available starting in the Fortress Age and is effective against heavy infantry and light cavalry but weak against heavy cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162106">Representing the elite guards of magnates, the Neftenya utilized a rifle and shield combination that became characteristic of East African troops. Deadly in combat and imposing in appearance, the mere sight of these bold riflemen and their colorful shields could be sufficient to put an enemy force to flight.</string>
    <string _locid="162107">Sebastopol Mortar</string>
    <string _locid="162108">The Sebastopol Mortar is a unique Ethiopian artillery unit. It is available starting in the Fortress Age and, like the Mortar, is particularly effective when firing its large explosive rounds into buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="162109">Lacking his own siege artillery, the Emperor Tewodros II attempted to have some cannons cast, but without industrialized infrastructure this proved difficult. He resorted to seizing some European dignitaries and missionaries to barter for assistance from the British, but the plan backfired; the British instead invaded his realm to liberate the hostages. At the Battle of Magdala in 1868, the British force annihilated Tewodros’ army, causing the emperor to commit suicide. Tewodros’ single mortar, named Sebastopol for a battle during the Crimean War, rests on the site of the battlefield to this very day.</string>
    <string _locid="162110">Levies</string>
    <string _locid="162111">Levies are unique African units that can be quickly trained at Huts for a small Influence cost. When called, three unit types arrive: the Levy Spearman, which is strong against cavalry; the Levy Archer, which is strong against infantry; and the Levy Gunner, which is strong against artillery. While swift, Levies’ hit points deteriorate over time, making them useful for last-resort defenses but unreliable for sustained offensives.		\n\nAmong larger African societies, the majority of military forces were levies organized within individual villages in a pseudo-feudal system. The Hut’s ability to call levies represents that system and reflects the reality that, while numerous, levies were not necessarily the most effective troops on an individual basis.</string>
    <string _locid="162113">Fishing Canoe</string>
    <string _locid="162114">The Fishing Canoe is a unique African vessel available in the Exploration Age. Like the Fishing Ships of other civilizations, Fishing Canoes can fish or whale the ocean for food or coin; however, they can also defend themselves with a small, low-damage attack. </string>
    <string _locid="162115">Teeming with aquatic life and serving as highways between regions, the rivers and coasts of Africa were ideal venues for fishing and trade. Small water crafts plied the waterways in search of food – and were always prepared to fend off predators or raiders.</string>
    <string _locid="162116">Battle Canoe</string>
    <string _locid="162117">The Battle Canoe is a unique African vessel available in the Commerce Age. Battle Canoes fire flaming arrows at other ships and guns at infantry. They also train several land military units. </string>
    <string _locid="162118">In addition to being sources of food and routes of commerce, the rivers and coasts of Africa were often hotly contested naval battlegrounds. Although small, the canoes that traversed these waterways were mobile and their formidable crews could pack quite a punch.</string>
    <string _locid="162119">Cannon Boat</string>
    <string _locid="162120">The Cannon Boat is a unique African vessel available in the Fortress Age. Cannon Boats are equipped with a single cannon mounted at the prow, and excel at bombarding fortifications but have a low rate of fire and are vulnerable to other warships. </string>
    <string _locid="162121">Though relatively late to arrive on the scene in sub-Saharan African warfare, artillery – however rare – could be used to great effect. While impactful on land, its appearance also sparked a decline in the dominance of coastal fortresses as nigh-impregnable strategic bastions. When mounted on warships, cannons could obliterate coastal fortifications.</string>
    <string _locid="162122">Xebec</string>
    <string _locid="162123">The Xebec is a North African mercenary warship. Xebecs are agile, swift, and powerful vessels that can train several units and have a quick fire rate at close range. </string>
    <string _locid="162124">Light, agile, and swift, the Xebec was the favored warship of the Barbary pirates of the North African coast. While their design made them better suited for quick raids than for pitched naval battles, Xebecs were feared throughout the Mediterranean – and highly sought after by those seeking to enlist their crews in illicit activities.</string>
    <string _locid="162125">War Dhow</string>
    <string _locid="162126">The War Dhow is an East African mercenary warship. A powerful cannon ship, the War Dhow can use the Broadside attack ability, train units, and dish out heavy fire at a moderate rate. Its relatively short range is a shortcoming that its agility compensates for, allowing this sturdy vessel to maneuver in and out of fights at opportune moments. </string>
    <string _locid="162127">The term “dhow” refers to many subclasses of vessels rigged with lateen sails used by the cultures inhabiting the coasts of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Lateen rigged ships, with their ability to easily tack and maneuver, were perfect for plying the waterways of this region and adapting to the changing currents and winds. Although originally used primarily by merchants and explorers, dhows also found a niche as versatile and dangerous warships.</string>
    <string _locid="162128">Cart</string>
    <string _locid="162129">Carts replace Wagons and are unique to African civilizations. Like the Wagons that they replace, Carts carry the supplies required to construct various buildings.		\n\nAn indispensably useful vehicle, the cart was used to transport various supplies and building materials. Carts could be pulled by any number of draft animals: oxen, donkeys, and even occasionally camels.</string>
    <string _locid="162131">Kanuri Guard</string>
    <string _locid="162132">The Kanuri Guard is a mercenary ranged cavalry unit. Like the Dragoon, it is effective against cavalry but weak against most other units.</string>
    <string _locid="162133">The Kingdom of Kanem-Bornu was early to adopt gunpowder into its armies. Used to greatest effect by Idris Alooma (c. 16th century), chain mail-clad riders with muskets posed a durable and deadly threat to their adversaries.</string>
    <string _locid="162134">Dahomey Amazon</string>
    <string _locid="162135">The Dahomey Amazon is a mercenary light infantry unit. Like the Skirmisher, it is effective against heavy infantry but weak against heavy cavalry. Dahomey Amazons fire rifles from a distance but hurl knives at units that approach them.</string>
    <string _locid="162136">During the 17th century, the West African Kingdom of Dahomey formed an all-female military unit. These gbetos gradually rose in importance and were known for their combined use of firearms and throwing knives. An aberration to European observers, who termed them “Amazons” after the female warriors of classical Greek mythology, the gbetos remained a fixture in the Dahomey army until the kingdom’s conquest by the French in the late 19th century.</string>
    <string _locid="162137">Askari</string>
    <string _locid="162138">The Askari is a mercenary heavy infantry unit. Like the Musketeer, it is effective against cavalry, but with one key difference: its ranged attack is stronger than its melee attack in this regard. Like other heavy infantry, it is weak against light infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="162139">Askari were African military units that were recruited and drilled by European powers controlling regions such as Central and East Africa. While they primarily served in their homelands, many were also enlisted as auxiliary forces in foreign conflicts between European powers.</string>
    <string _locid="162140">Zenata Rider</string>
    <string _locid="162141">The Zenata Rider is a mercenary ranged cavalry unit. Like the Javelin Rider, it is effective against cavalry but weak against most other units.</string>
    <string _locid="162142">The Zenata are a Berber or Amazigh people-group famed for their historical use of cavalry, a mantle dating back at least to the medieval period. These swift light cavalry charged into battle armed with heart-shaped shields and several spears that could be hurled or thrust. They were so effective that their arrival in Spain spawned a new military designation, the Jinete or Genitour, whose name and fighting style were directly derived from the Zenata cavalry. Their use persisted well into the early modern period.</string>
    <string _locid="162143">Sennar Horseman</string>
    <string _locid="162144">The Sennar Horseman is a mercenary heavy cavalry unit. Like the Lifidi Knight, it has a powerful melee attack as well as armor against both melee and ranged attacks, making it an immensely versatile unit.</string>
    <string _locid="162145">The Sennar Sultanate (16th-19th centuries) in modern-day Sudan was a feudal society that relied on local magnates to raise armies when a conflict arose. The main metric along which military power in Sennar was measured was in the strength of mounted cavalry. These heavily armored riders were the pride of their armies, and their influence was such that for reasons of self-preservation they delayed the integration of firearms into Sennar armies, much to the Sultanate’s detriment.</string>
    <string _locid="162146">Cannoneer</string>
    <string _locid="162147">The Cannoneer is a mercenary ranged infantry unit. Like the Abus Gun, it is effective against infantry and deals siege damage in its attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="162148">It was not at all uncommon for European adventurers and soldiers of fortune to pledge themselves to foreign rulers in exchange for vast sums of money. Cannoneers represent the vast number of European mercenaries who used advanced weaponry such as early muskets to carve out a niche in foreign lands, such as the Kongolese Kingdom, where military technology was not yet quite as advanced.</string>
    <string _locid="162149">Gating Camel</string>
    <string _locid="162150">The Gatling Camel is a mercenary artillery unit. Like the Gatling Gun, it is especially effective against infantry but vulnerable to cavalry and other artillery.</string>
    <string _locid="162151">When the Gatling Gun made its way to Africa and the Middle East during the 19th century, it was first used by European powers to overcome much larger forces. However, the so-called Gunpowder Empires of the Middle East soon adopted this technology and began to mount Gatling Guns atop camels as a replacement for the zamburak, an artillery piece that was then gradually rendered obsolete by its more effective successor.</string>
    <string _locid="162152">Desert Raider</string>
    <string _locid="162153">The Desert Raider is an outlaw cavalry unit that is especially effective against buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="162154">The deserts and plains of Africa played host to many nomadic and pastoralist groups. While some were largely peaceful, others practiced a far more predatory existence and raided rival groups and sedentary settlements to capture or extort resources.</string>
    <string _locid="162155">Desert Archer</string>
    <string _locid="162156">The Desert Archer is an outlaw ranged infantry unit that is especially effective against infantry. Accurate at long range, the Desert Archer can also rapidly fire arrows against adversaries at close range.</string>
    <string _locid="162157">The deserts and plains of Africa played host to many nomadic and pastoralist groups. While some were largely peaceful, others practiced a far more predatory existence and raided rival groups and sedentary settlements to capture or extort resources.</string>
    <string _locid="162158">Desert Warrior</string>
    <string _locid="162159">The Desert Warrior is an outlaw heavy infantry unit armed with a javelin and a shield. Although especially effective against cavalry, this hardy warrior excels in a variety of situations.</string>
    <string _locid="162160">The deserts and plains of Africa played host to many nomadic and pastoralist groups. While some were largely peaceful, others practiced a far more predatory existence and raided rival groups and sedentary settlements to capture or extort resources.</string>
    <string _locid="162161">Raider</string>
    <string _locid="162162">The Raider is a unique Hausa heavy cavalry unit. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and is effective against ranged infantry and Villagers but weak against heavy infantry and light cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162163">Songhai and Hausa military forces used their cavalry to deadly effect not only on the battlefield but also outside of it. Raiding bands harried the enemy countryside, looting resources for their own armies and cutting off enemy supplies.</string>
    <string _locid="162164">Fulani Archer</string>
    <string _locid="162165">The Fulani Archer is a unique Hausa ranged infantry unit that uses a bow for a rapid but short ranged attack. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and is effective against heavy infantry and light cavalry but weak against heavy cavalry. Fulani Archers can also gather meat from livestock.</string>
    <string _locid="162166">The Fulani tradition of hunting with short bows was leveraged into a powerful military asset by Usman dan Fodio (1754-1817). Realizing that he could not match the Hausa cavalry man-to-man, Usman instead overcame them with shrewd skirmishing tactics involving well-placed foot archers.</string>
    <string _locid="162167">Griot</string>
    <string _locid="162168">The Griot is a unique Hausa unit. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and can either empower nearby buildings to increase their efficiency, or slow the movement of enemy units.</string>
    <string _locid="162169">The griot, a keeper of oral tradition responsible for entertaining and educating his people with tales and epics, was a key figure among several rural and nomadic groups in West Africa. In telling their epics, Griots praised and memorialized influential figures such as Sundjata Keita and Mansa Musa for posterity.</string>
    <string _locid="162170">Lifidi Knight</string>
    <string _locid="162171">The Lifidi Knight is a unique Hausa heavy cavalry unit. It is available starting in the Fortress Age and is effective against a variety of units but weak against heavy infantry and light cavalry. Though immensely durable owing to their armor against both melee and ranged attacks, Lifidi Knights come with an expensive coin cost.</string>
    <string _locid="162172">Lifidi, a unique form of quilted armor, was a staple among cavalrymen in West and Central African societies such as the Hausa, the Fulani, the Sudanese, and the Kanem-Bornu. Lifidi was effective at parrying both melee and ranged attacks, and these feudal cavalrymen, though only comprising a minority of their armies, accounted for a disproportionate amount of their power.</string>
    <string _locid="162173">Maigadi</string>
    <string _locid="162174">The Maigadi is a unique Hausa ranged infantry unit. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and is versatile but especially effective against mercenary units.</string>
    <string _locid="162175">The Maigadi (bodyguards) were the personal guards of Hausa emirs. In an ever-shifting and often treacherous political climate, the ability to trust in those nearest to oneself was paramount. Maigadi not only safeguarded the welfare of the emir but also served as a private army of sorts.</string>
    <string _locid="162176">African Villager</string>
    <string _locid="162177">African Villagers are similar in function to European Settlers. Just like Settlers, they gather resources, collect Treasures, and construct buildings – but they hunt and fight with bows rather than blunderbusses.</string>
    <string _locid="162178">Akan Tufohen</string>
    <string _locid="162179">The Tufohen is a powerful chieftain who attacks primarily with a pistol, but will also deploy a deadly Akrafena sword and shield in battle. He is especially effective against cavalry and gains strength when accompanied by Native warriors. The Tufohen can also heal and construct certain buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="162180">The tufohen were leaders of the asafo, formidable Akan warrior companies who dominated the Gold Coast. Wielding their deadly characteristic akrafena swords, they represented the height of warrior culture and led their men fearlessly into battle. A tufohen was only as powerful as his retinue, however, and every loss diminished his power.</string>
    <string _locid="162181">Akan Ankobia</string>
    <string _locid="162182">The Ankobia is a powerful Akan light infantry unit who wields a musket. Ankobia have higher base damage than Skirmishers, but no additional bonus damage against heavy infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="162183">The ankobia were a company of asafo musketmen who resided in the Ashanti capital as royal guards and police. The Ashanti were among the first in the region to form a proficient dedicated musketeer corps, and – wisely – tended to fire their muskets from the hip, a tactic that precluded extensive damage from firearm malfunctions common at the time.</string>
    <string _locid="162184">Berber Camel Rider</string>
    <string _locid="162185">The Camel Rider is a powerful Berber cavalry unit that excels at fighting other cavalry units. Unlike all other Hand Cavalry, it is classed as "Light Cavalry" meaning it is more similar to and countered by the same units as Ranged Cavalry, such as Dragoons.</string>
    <string _locid="162186">Although not the primary mount of choice in most situations, camels had an attribute that made them deadly against forces of enemy cavalry: their smell terrifies horses. Armed with a straight takoba sword – a weapon typical of the Tuareg, Hausa, and Fulani – camel riders posed a formidable challenge to opposing mounted forces.</string>
    <string _locid="162187">Berber Nomad</string>
    <string _locid="162188">The Nomad is a unique Berber Villager that grows stronger in groups. Nomads cannot gather from Mills, Estates, or any other agricultural building, but they exceed other Villagers’ gather rates from all natural resources. Nomads can also gather resources from crates.</string>
    <string _locid="162189">Called “kings of the desert”, the Berbers’ and Tuaregs’ ability to navigate and survive the desert elements placed them in a crucial position of power. The ability to thrive in this harsh environment and leverage its resources made them indispensable allies and deadly opponents.</string>
    <string _locid="162190">Berber Salt Camel</string>
    <string _locid="162191">The Salt Camel is a Berber unit that is capable of discovering (creating) a Salt Mine, a source of coin.</string>
    <string _locid="162192">Berber caravans played a crucial role in the thriving salt trade that traversed much of Africa, whether in the Sahara or the Afar Triangle. In the premodern world, salt was of crucial value not only as a seasoning but also as a preservative. Although slow to mine and refine, salt paid dividends and was at one point in time more valuable than gold.</string>
    <string _locid="162193">Berber Sultan</string>
    <string _locid="162194">The Sultan is a powerful Berber heavy cavalry hero unit. He heals, gains strength when accompanied by Outlaws and Mercenaries, and can train Barbary Corsair and Zenata Rider mercenary units. The Sultan can also construct certain buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="162195">The Berbers, or Amazigh (meaning “free people”) are among the indigenous inhabitants of much of North and Northwest Africa. These diverse regions gave rise to several ways of life: some Amazigh were sedentary agriculturalists or urban residents, while many others were pastoralists. All enjoyed the benefits of living near or on the vibrant trade routes spanning the northern part of the African continent.		\n\nBy the early modern period, the Ottoman Empire controlled most of the core Amazigh lands either directly or through client kingdoms. The most notable exception was the Saadi Sultanate (1510-1659) in modern-day Morocco, which used a modernized army and shrewd diplomacy to maintain its independence, even defeating a large Portuguese invasion force at Alcacer Quibir in 1578. After their eventual collapse in the 17th century, the Saadis were replaced by the Alaouites, who despite periods of Spanish and French dominion still rule the region today.</string>
    <string _locid="162196">Somali Issa Warrior</string>
    <string _locid="162197">The Issa Warrior is a powerful Somali heavy infantry unit who wields a javelin. Issa Warriors attack closer targets faster but can also counter cavalry at range.</string>
    <string _locid="162198">The Issa were a subgroup of the Dir, a large people-group in modern-day Djibouti, who often competed with their rivals the Afar. The Issa comprised a key part of the Adal Sultanate (15th-16th centuries), which controlled much of East Africa and the trade therein.</string>
    <string _locid="162199">Somali Darood Militia</string>
    <string _locid="162200">The Darood Militia is a powerful Somali ranged infantry unit who wields a heavy musket. Darood Militia are best used against artillery and ships.</string>
    <string _locid="162201">Somali society during the early modern period was organized into clans. One of the largest and most dominant, the Darood, produced a large number of magnates and even sultans throughout Somali history.</string>
    <string _locid="162202">Sudanese Dervish</string>
    <string _locid="162203">The Dervish is a powerful but fragile Sudanese spearman unit who also hurls a throwing knife at short range. Dervishes attack melee units faster as their hit points decrease, and attack ranged units faster when they are within a certain distance.</string>
    <string _locid="162204">Dervish was a name given to members of the Mahdist movement, an Islamic ascetic sect. Known for their piety, white robes with colored rectangles, and whirling dance, Dervishes could be as powerful on the battlefield as they were spiritual.</string>
    <string _locid="162205">Yoruba Oyo Legionary</string>
    <string _locid="162206">The Oyo Legionary is a powerful Yoruba heavy infantry unit who wields a javelin. Oyo Legionaries attack closer targets faster, carry shields for protection against ranged attacks, and are effective against cavalry units.</string>
    <string _locid="162207">Oyo infantry were among the most organized and formidable fighting forces on the African continent during the early modern period. Reminiscent to their counterparts in Imperial Rome over a millennium prior, they were issued standardized equipment: a shield, an ida sword, and javelins. Oyo infantry sometimes poisoned their blades, lending themselves an extra dimension of power and danger on the battlefield.</string>
    <string _locid="162208">Yoruba Eso Rider</string>
    <string _locid="162209">The Eso Rider is a powerful Yoruba heavy cavalry unit who wields a lance. Eso Riders lose hit points over time, but attack targets faster as their hit points dip. Their ranged and melee armor lend a degree of durability that makes them deadly even when heavily damaged.</string>
    <string _locid="162210">The Eso were an elite cavalry force in Ikoyi whose status was hereditary and highly prized as part of a complex warrior society. While powerful due to their weaponry, training, and military tradition, they had a crucial weakness: the horses on which they relied were in increasingly dwindling supply due to the climate and the predation of the parasitic tsetse fly.</string>
    <string _locid="162211">Caravan, Guide</string>
    <string _locid="162212">Caravans are neutral units that traverse the land trade routes of Africa and the Middle East. When they pass a Trading Post, they will generate a resource – food, wood, coin, or Experience – for the player owning it. Guides walk the route on foot and thus are slower and carry fewer resources.</string>
    <string _locid="162213">The various regions of Africa and the Middle East engaged in one of the most lively series of trade networks in human history. Land routes were often traversed by caravans, large convoys of merchants, their pack animals, and – when applicable – their guards. Laden with resources and riches, caravans were fruitful enterprises – and even more tempting targets.</string>
    <string _locid="162214">Caravan, Pack Camel</string>
    <string _locid="162215">Caravans are neutral units that traverse the land trade routes of Africa and the Middle East. When they pass a Trading Post, they will generate a resource – food, wood, coin, or Experience – for the player owning it. Pack Camels are faster than Guides and carry more resources.</string>
    <string _locid="162216">The various regions of Africa and the Middle East engaged in one of the most lively series of trade networks in human history.

    <string _locid="162217">Trade Ship, Carrack</string>
    <string _locid="162218">Trade Ships are neutral units that traverse the sea trade routes of Africa and the Middle East. When they pass a Trading Post, they will generate a resource – food, wood, coin, or Experience – for the player owning it. Carracks are slower and carry fewer resources than Trade Galleons or East Indiamen.</string>
    <string _locid="162219">The various regions of Africa and the Middle East engaged in one of the most lively series of trade networks in human history. Sea routes were often traversed by large cargo ships such as carracks, which could carry more than caravels and were more seaworthy. Laden with resources and riches, trade ships were fruitful enterprises – and even more tempting targets.</string>
    <string _locid="162220">Trade Ship, Trade Galleon</string>
    <string _locid="162221">Trade Ships are neutral units that traverse the sea trade routes of Africa and the Middle East. When they pass a Trading Post, they will generate a resource – food, wood, coin, or Experience – for the player owning it. Trade Galleons are more efficient than Carracks but less efficient than East Indiamen.</string>
    <string _locid="162222">The various regions of Africa and the Middle East engaged in one of the most lively series of trade networks in human history. Sea routes were often traversed by large cargo ships such as galleons, which were even more seaworthy and could carry more than carracks. Laden with resources and riches, trade ships were fruitful enterprises – and even more tempting targets.</string>
    <string _locid="162223">Trade Ship, East Indiaman</string>
    <string _locid="162224">Trade Ships are neutral units that traverse the sea trade routes of Africa and the Middle East. When they pass a Trading Post, they will generate a resource – food, wood, coin, or Experience – for the player owning it. The East Indiaman is the most efficient Trade Ship.</string>
    <string _locid="162225">The various regions of Africa and the Middle East engaged in one of the most lively series of trade networks in human history. Sea routes were often traversed by large cargo ships. Laden with resources and riches, trade ships were fruitful enterprises – and even more tempting targets. To combat the threat of piracy and protect royal and entrepreneurial investments, several European nations formed trading companies. Their vessels, East Indiamen, were officially licensed to trade and were capable of carrying immense amounts of goods while defending themselves from pirates.</string>
    <string _locid="162226">Zebu Cattle</string>
    <string _locid="162227">Zebu Cattle are herdable animals available to the Ethiopians by default. They can be fattened at the Livestock Market, a process which also generates Influence for the Ethiopian player.</string>
    <string _locid="162228">Like for several other world societies, livestock played a crucial role among several African people-groups – sedentary and pastoral-nomadic – both as a source of food and as a symbol of wealth. As such, livestock markets were prime loci of economic commercial transactions, whether they were within a society, with foreign merchants, or as a bridge between sedentary and pastoral-nomadic groups.</string>
    <string _locid="162229">Sanga Cattle</string>
    <string _locid="162230">Sanga Cattle are herdable animals available to the Hausa by default. They can be fattened at the Livestock Market, a process which also generates Influence for the Hausa player.</string>
    <string _locid="162231">Like for several other world societies, livestock played a crucial role among several African people-groups – sedentary and pastoral-nomadic – both as a source of food and as a symbol of wealth. As such, livestock markets were prime loci of economic commercial transactions, whether they were within a society, with foreign merchants, or as a bridge between sedentary and pastoral-nomadic groups.</string>
    <string _locid="162232">Mine, Salt</string>
    <string _locid="162233">Salt mines are sources of coin that are gathered quite slowly but have a relatively high yield.</string>
    <string _locid="162234">In the premodern world, salt was of crucial value not only as a seasoning but also as a preservative. Although slow to mine and refine, salt paid dividends and was at one point in time more valuable than gold.</string>
    <string _locid="162235">Mine, Coal</string>
    <string _locid="162236">Coal mines are sources of coin that are gathered quite swiftly but have a relatively low yield.</string>
    <string _locid="162237">Coal rose to prominence as a key resource during the Industrial Era, when engineers realized that it could be burned to power machinery. Dangerous to mine and gather, coal’s value is temporary because it is non-renewable – once burned off, its user must then seek more.</string>
    <string _locid="162238">Mine, Diamond</string>
    <string _locid="162239">Diamond mines are a source of coin available through the South Africa Revolution option. They are immensely valuable, yielding up to 100,000 coin.</string>
    <string _locid="162240">Prized by humans for their shining beauty, diamonds were and continue to be a coveted resource in South-Central Africa. Their appeal has made them a source of immense wealth – but also of deadly conflict.</string>
    <string _locid="162241">Giraffe</string>
    <string _locid="162242">Scientific name: Giraffa camelopardalis\nApproximate size: 4-6m; 800-1200kg\nDiet: Herbivorous</string>
    <string _locid="162243">The giraffe is a mammal native to the African continent. In Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, it can be hunted for food.</string>

    <string _locid="162283">For centuries Barbary Pirates from North Africa raided merchant ships with impunity. A new emerging power, the United States, was determined to put an end to these practices and declared war on the pirates. The war was going in America’s favor yet distaster struck when on a mission to sink corsair ships, one of the most important US frigates, the USS Philadelphia, was captured intact by the Barbary Pirates. The United State’s prestige took a severe hit and the pirates now possessed one of the mightiest war ships of the time. One brave young American Lieutenant, however, was not willing to let this pass. Stephen Decatur assembled a group of volunteers and set sail to destroy the frigate and restore America’s reputation.</string>

    <string _locid="162306">Italians</string>
    <string _locid="162307">As the early modern period dawned, the Italian peninsula was divided between a plethora of small states: merchant republics, kingdoms, duchies, and even the Papacy. These entities, most of which were fabulously wealthy, had driven the Renaissance and dominated the trade networks of the Mediterranean. Such high stakes invited conflict, however, and when the Italian polities were not engaged in conflicts abroad, they fought each other nearly incessantly.\n\nFor a long time, trade networks between Europe and the lands to the east had flourished, but this changed during the 15th century when the expanding Ottoman Empire vanquished the declining Byzantine Empire and incorporated its lands. Intense rivalry between the Ottomans and European states led to the closure of the traditional trade routes east, and so the latter sought other ways to reach the trading hubs of Asia. While the Italian states spearheaded very few of these efforts, many of their people joined the exploration efforts that sailed in all directions, charting routes around Africa and also reaching the Americas.\n\nWhile many other European states settled these lands, the Italian states seldom did so, being preoccupied with Mediterranean trade and rivalries with the Ottomans and with each other. Further, as the settlement of other continents proved a lucrative business, competition was high, and the small Italian states did not have the power to compete with their larger neighbors in Europe. Although they played a pivotal role in early modern events in their sphere of influence, most notably the Wars of the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire (16th-17th centuries) and the Thirty Years’ War (17th century), their decline progressed swiftly. By the time that the Napoleonic Wars began at the turn of the 19th century, their splendor was past, and they were easily conquered by the French Empire.\n\nAdversity drove ambition, however, and after the collapse of the French Empire in 1815, many residents of the Italian states saw the need for unity – a process that would consume the following six decades. Through war and diplomacy, these regions coalesced into one nation-state – largely thanks to the leadership of the so-called Four Fathers of the Fatherland: Victor Emmanuel, Camillo Benso, Giuseppe Mazzini, and most famously, Giuseppe Garibaldi. In 1871, the unification process – or Risorgimento – ended when the new Kingdom of Italy annexed the Papal States and proclaimed Rome its new capital.</string>
    <string _locid="162308">Giuseppe Garibaldi</string>
    <string _locid="162309">Giuseppe Garibaldi was born in 1807 to a Nicoise-Italian family of seagoing merchants. He took up the same career in his youth, sailing from port to port making connections and becoming wise to the world. One of these encounters – with Giuseppe Mazzini in Genoa – would change the trajectory of his life. At the time, Mazzini was the leading proponent of Italian unification, a cause with an increasingly large number of supporters, and one which drew much ire from the ruling authorities. In 1834, Garibaldi was forced to flee Italy to escape a death sentence.\n\n\nSeeking his fortune elsewhere, Garibaldi sailed to Brazil, where he continued his mercantile work but also became involved in numerous revolutionary conflicts there and in nearby regions. An adept soldier and a better leader, he swiftly rose to positions of command wherever he went; by 1842, Garibaldi was in sole command of the Uruguayan navy – but his wife Ana Maria, a capable soldier herself, remained his closest confidante.\n\n\nDespite his success abroad, Garibaldi never forgot his homeland or the cause that he had championed while there. In 1848, he returned to an Italy wracked by civil wars and invasive intervention from other European states, particularly France, Spain, and Austria. After a failed defense of Rome, Garibaldi and his revolutionaries retreated into the nearby mountains, where he suffered yet another tragedy: the death of his wife Ana Maria. Desperate and hunted, he had no choice but to flee again, this time to the United States, where he had several connections in the form of other exiled revolutionaries and fellow Freemasons. Various jobs and expeditions made him even more well-traveled, taking him as far as England, China, and South Africa.\n\n\nGaribaldi’s third stint in Italy began in 1854, when his attempt at farming was interrupted by further revolutionary conflict. This particular war was to reshape his mentality; having followed Mazzini’s republican ideals for so long, Garibaldi now championed the pragmatic conviction that the only route to unification was through a powerful, centralized monarchy. Thus began an uneasy alliance with the Piedmontese, his former rivals, and for the next decade and a half Garibaldi strove to bring the squabbling Italian states under one banner. Ever a man of the world, Garibaldi very nearly crossed the Atlantic to command the Union army in the American Civil War, desiring to end the practice of slavery there.\n\nIn 1870, the Franco-Prussian War broke out, forcing the desperate French to withdraw their garrison in Rome. This presented a spectacular opportunity to incorporate the Papal States into the young Italian nation, and they did not let it pass. The unification of Italy was complete. Garibaldi turned his attention to aiding revolutionaries abroad while championing political activism both at home and elsewhere. His crowning political achievement was his election to a seat on the Italian parliament, where he often clashed vehemently with some of his former allies. He died of natural causes in 1882, forever an Italian hero.\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Giuseppe Garibaldi is the impassioned and daring leader that he was in life. In battle, his stubborn defense against all odds can prove both tenacious and effective, while his subsequent counterattacks will be as swift as they are decisive. Knowing the advantages modern technology can bring, he will invest his nations resources towards a plethora of economic and military upgrades. Garibaldi did not overthrow old tyrants to become a new one, for his people he values wellbeing and liberty above all, free to think, speak, and act as they choose, knowing that in return they will always be on his side. For his allies, he will be a loyal defender of their own freedoms at any cost, but expects the same support in return.</string>
    <string _locid="162310">Basilica</string>
    <string _locid="162311">The Basilica is a unique Italian building available starting in the Commerce Age. Basilicas have positive impacts on assets in their vicinity: nearby Settlers and Architects work faster, while buildings constructed near a Basilica grant additional Experience when completed. Basilicas train Priests, Spies, and Papal Guards, as well as several unique Italian units that represent ‘naturalized’ versions of mercenaries hailing from the region.</string>
    <string _locid="162312">Basilicas have their origin in Roman antiquity, where they served as public buildings. However, with the rise of Christianity, they became gradually repurposed as religious structures. By the early modern period, a basilica was a grand, lavish building with a primarily religious function, such as St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican of Rome. Basilicas are denoted by the umbraculum, a papal symbol, and enjoy additional privileges and ceremonial status compared to churches.</string>
    <string _locid="162313">Lombard</string>
    <string _locid="162314">The Lombard is a unique Italian building. Lombards can train mercenaries and allow players to deposit resources that will be exchanged into different resources over time. Like Dutch Banks, they have a low build limit, however.</string>
    <string _locid="162315">As mercantile enterprises exploded during the early modern period, the practices of banking and money lending – frowned upon by the Catholic Church as usury, became increasingly crucial and lucrative. Material concerns trumped moral misgivings and bankers quickly became among the most powerful figures in Lombardy, a region in northern Italy. The practice soon expanded not just to neighboring regions, but also to all of Europe and beyond, where the term “Lombard” was adopted as a loanword into most local languages – denoting the professions of banking and money lending.</string>
    <string _locid="162316">Architect</string>
    <string _locid="162317">The Architect is a unique Italian civilian unit that is available starting in the Exploration Age. Architects can slowly construct buildings for free, or more quickly for a higher cost. When not working on a building, Architects can also gather wood.</string>
    <string _locid="162318">The birthplace of the Renaissance, Italy swiftly became renowned for the grand and lavish structures that its ruling families commissioned as a show of might and piety. Equally famous were the architects of such wonders, whose craft has a legacy stemming from Roman antiquity. Decorated figures such as Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci – among others – loom large in world history as pioneers in a field as crucial today as it was then.</string>
    <string _locid="162319">Cardinal</string>
    <string _locid="162320">The Cardinal is a unique Italian healer unit that replaces the Priest. It can be trained in the Basilica starting in the Commerce Age and has several special abilities. It can convert buildings, reduce the strength of a single enemy unit, and increase the strength of a single allied unit.</string>
    <string _locid="162321">Originally, the term “cardinal” was used to designate only the senior clergymen in the city of Rome – men who were eligible to be elected to the papacy in the event of the Pope’s death. Over time, however, the title began to be conferred on certain eminent church figures in other regions of Europe, and eventually some of these came to serve in Rome, presiding over one of the city’s churches and electing new popes from among their own ranks. While cardinals in Rome tended to wield more power within the Catholic Church than elsewhere, those residing in other states often held a significant amount of secular influence as well, making them formidable political figures.</string>
    <string _locid="162322">Papal Guard</string>
    <string _locid="162323">The Papal Guard is a unique Italian unit that can be trained in the Basilica starting in the Commerce Age. Papal Guards are heavy infantry units that regenerate, can deflect a portion of damage from attacks targeting adjacent allied units, and can also use a powerful charged pistol attack against enemy units.</string>
    <string _locid="162324">During the late medieval period, the Swiss Confederacy rose to international fame due to its adept use of polearm tactics on difficult terrain to crush invading enemy armies such as those of the Duchy of Burgundy. This reputation caused neighboring regions to enlist them as mercenaries – one such being the Papacy, which hired its first regiment in 1506. After the conclusion of the Italian War of 1551-1559, the Swiss Papal Guard was relegated from field service to become a personal bodyguard of the Pope in Rome – a decision borne partially out of the desire to preserve these valuable troops, and also owing to their outstanding record in military service. Five centuries later, the Swiss Papal Guard remains the bodyguard of the Pope.</string>
    <string _locid="162325">Papal Zouave</string>
    <string _locid="162326">The Papal Zouave is a unique Italian unit that can be trained in the Basilica starting in the Industrial Age. Like their mercenary counterpart the Zouave, Papal Zouaves are tanky ranged infantry units that can deflect or absorb a portion of damage from the attacks of enemy ranged infantry units targeting adjacent allied units.</string>
    <string _locid="162327">During the 19th century, Zouaves were a light infantry force in the French army recruited primarily from their overseas territories in Africa -- an origin which their name reflects. A variant also developed that was dedicated to the defense of the Papal States, and which primarily drew on devout Catholics from a variety of regions, but also some locals. The Papal Zouaves opposed Garibaldi’s forces during the Risorgimento, but were defeated in 1870.</string>
    <string _locid="162328">Papal Lancer</string>
    <string _locid="162329">The Papal Lancer is a unique Italian heavy hand cavalry unit that can be trained in the Basilica starting in the Fortress Age. Papal Lancers are similar to their mercenary counterparts, the Elmetti, but can deflect or absorb a portion of damage from the attacks of enemy cavalry units targeting adjacent allied units.</string>
    <string _locid="162330">During the late medieval and early modern periods, surplus of wealth combined with manpower shortages led the Papacy to the natural conclusion of relying on mercenaries for military strength. Some of these were drawn from the so-called lanze spezzate, individual lancer cavalrymen who were hired into mercenary companies. Papal armies were at their most powerful in the 17th century, but then gradually declined with the rise of nation-states with greater power and resources as religious influence waned.</string>
    <string _locid="162331">Galleass</string>
    <string _locid="162332">The Galleass replaces the Galleon and is unique to the Italians. It is available at the Dock starting in the Fortress Age and, like the Galleon, is a sturdy ship that can train units. However, it also has a roundel with multiple rows of guns, allowing it to fire in all directions without needing to turn about and reorient itself.</string>
    <string _locid="162333">The calmer waters of the Mediterranean played host to vessels such as galleys that generally favored a sturdier, heavier construction in contrast with the ships of northern European states, which had to combine integrity with flexibility to withstand the vicissitudes of the brutal Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. The pinnacle of this technology was the Venetian galleass, a monstrous vessel that dwarfed the galleys whose use was standard at the time. Armed to the teeth with artillery and a large crew, galleasses could unleash deadly barrages, but were also sturdy enough to plow through enemy ships. At the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, Venetian galleasses were known to have crushed countless Ottoman vessels by salvo or by ram.</string>
    <string _locid="162334">Pavisier</string>
    <string _locid="162335">The Pavisier replaces the Crossbowman and is unique to the Italians. It is available at the Barracks starting in the Commerce Age and, owing to its pavise shield, costs more wood than food. It also has a different armor class depending on which stance it is set in, lending it more versatility than the Crossbowmen of other civilizations.</string>
    <string _locid="162336">During the medieval period, the crossbow was refined to a point where it became one of the most effective firearms due to its ability to pierce thick armor and the ease with which it could be operated. The latter attribute kept it relevant even into the early modern period, when most armies gradually abandoned the use of exorbitantly expensive, cumbersome armor that was often unable to protect its wearer against newer weapons. However, a crossbow took roughly a minute to reload, and during this time (and while firing, for that matter), the crossbowman was exposed. The pavise, a large shield, was designed to protect these troops, and became particularly famous in Italy, where several city-states owned renowned armies of crossbowmen that often served as mercenaries in foreign armies.</string>
    <string _locid="162337">Bersagliere</string>
    <string _locid="162338">The Bersagliere is a unique Italian ranged infantry unit. This mobile skirmisher is available at the Barracks starting in the Industrial Age and sacrifices hit points for high armor and speed. Bersaglieri have a special charged ability, Bugle Call, which gets triggered after a Bersagliere kills another unit and automatically boosts the speed of nearby Bersaglieri.</string>
    <string _locid="162339">The Bersaglieri (sg. Bersagliere) were created in 1836 as mobile shock troops adept at skirmishing with enemy lines. Initially created by the Kingdom of Sardinia in the absence of a proper cavalry force, they distinguished themselves sufficiently to earn themselves a role in the Piedmontese army and, later, that of the unified Kingdom of Italy. Known for their speed, physical fitness, and distinct uniform of black coats and wide-brimmed hats, the Bersaglieri served as an elite force in the Italian military well into the 20th century.</string>
    <string _locid="162340">Schiavone</string>
    <string _locid="162341">The Schiavone is an Italian unique ranged infantry unit that is available in the Basilica starting in the Commerce Age. Schiavones are similar to their mercenary counterparts the Pandours, but have more hit points and cannot enter Stealth mode. Like Pandours, they attack their enemies with a rifle from range, but in contrast they are more effective against ranged infantry than heavy infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="162342">Schiavone, literally “Slav”, is an Italian term for Slavic migrants, many of whom settled in the territory of the Republic of Venice. Variously serving in military terms as soldiers, sailors, and shipwrights, some of these troops attained a special status as bodyguards of the Doge. Among other things, they gave their name to a fearsome sword of Balkan origin as well as the Riva degli Schiavoni, a famous section of the Venetian waterfront.</string>
    <string _locid="162343">Maltese</string>
    <string _locid="162344">One of the Mediterranean’s epitomes of a melting pot, early modern Malta, though initially under the rule of the Aragonese crown, was home to a diverse population of Muslims, Christians, and Jews of Maltese, North African, mainland European, and eastern Mediterranean heritages. Enjoying a prime position at a crossroads of Mediterranean trade, Malta was strategically and financially important, and thus most of the surrounding powers coveted it. Sensing its importance, the Holy Roman Empire leased the island in 1530 to the Knights Hospitaller, which had been rapidly losing its eastern Mediterranean territories and needed a new stronghold.\n\n\nThe Knights wasted no time in making use of their new possession. Perpetually at war with the Ottoman Empire, they used Malta as a base to raid Ottoman trade routes and turned it into a formidable fortified bastion. These renovations were to prove crucial, as the Ottomans launched a campaign in 1565 to conquer the island and expel the Knights. This battle, known to posterity as the Siege of Malta, became one of the most storied in early modern history. Vastly outnumbered and outgunned, the Knights, under the steadfast leadership of Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette, repelled the Ottomans.\n\n\nThe battle saw the use of innovative tactics on the part of the defense: on one occasion, the Knights hid artillery in their walls and then used it to blast apart a siege tower that Ottoman Janissaries were using to take potshots at defenders; on others, the Knights hurled incendiary wooden hoops at advancing Janissaries, starting wildfires that halted their advance. The rushing Ottoman tide, formerly deemed nigh-invincible, had been halted. Six years later, in 1571, a coalition of European states known as the Holy League annihilated the Ottoman navy at Lepanto, ending Ottoman thrusts into the western Mediterranean for a time.\n\n\nThe Knights, redubbed the Knights of Malta, had reached the apex of their power, and went into swift decline as the rise of powerful modernizing nation-states rendered archaic military orders obsolete. Although the Knights retained control of Malta, its strategic and economic importance waned during the age of exploration and settlement abroad. By 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte, driven by Alexandrian delusions of grandeur, had embarked on a campaign east towards Egypt, it took a mere ruse to topple the once-mighty Knights and seize Malta. Seized soon thereafter by the British navy, it remained in British hands well into the 20th century.</string>
    <string _locid="162345">Jean Parisot de la Valette</string>
    <string _locid="162346">Jean Parisot de la Valette was born in the 1490s (exact date uncertain) to a noble family in France with a storied legacy of participation in conflicts abroad. Following in his ancestors’ footsteps, he joined the Knights Hospitaller in his youth, relinquishing his family’s holdings. Over the following decades, he proved himself a stout and able soldier, enduring a chain of hardships parallel to the decline of the military order that he had joined. By the 1540s, he had seen the Knights’ former stronghold in Rhodes lost to the Ottomans, been captured and made a galley slave, and governed the Knights’ holdings in Tripoli following his ransom.\n\n\nValette’s persistence, work ethic, and ardent loyalty paid off when he was placed in command of the Knights’ fleet in 1554. This honor was swiftly followed by an even greater one: three years later, he was elected the Order’s new Grand Master, a decision likely also informed by his extensive battle experience against the Ottomans, who were known to be planning a campaign to oust the Knights from Malta and their other nearby holdings, thereby opening the western Mediterranean for Ottoman expeditions. In 1565, this great reckoning finally came. The battle, known to posterity as the Siege of Malta, became one of the most storied in early modern history. Vastly outnumbered and outgunned, the Knights, under Valette’s steadfast leadership, repelled the Ottomans.\n\n\nThe battle saw the use of innovative tactics on the part of the defense: on one occasion, the Knights hid artillery in their walls and then used it to blast apart a siege tower that Ottoman Janissaries were using to take potshots at defenders; on others, the Knights hurled incendiary wooden hoops at advancing Janissaries, starting wildfires that halted their advance. The rushing Ottoman tide, formerly deemed nigh-invincible, had been halted. This victory earned Valette a nomination as a cardinal, an offer that he politely declined in favor of his present position.\n\n\nShortly thereafter, Valette spearheaded the construction of a new capital city in Malta, which came to be known as Valletta, the present capital of the Maltese nation. Although he died a few years later in 1568, his actions bore immediate fruit: the Ottomans had been weakened, and the Knights were stronger than they had ever been since the height of the Crusades. Three years later, in 1571, a coalition of European states known as the Holy League annihilated the Ottoman navy at Lepanto, ending Ottoman thrusts into the western Mediterranean for a time.\n\n\nIn Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, Jean Parisot de la Valette is the resilient, undeterred commander that he was in reality. In his role as the shield of Europe, Valetta values a strong defense above anything else to uphold his sacred duties. As Grandmaster and knight of the Order of Malta, he prefers honorable hand to hand fighting for his well armored units. His economy stays safe behind his defenses and ready to support his army while it shatters every new wave of attackers.</string>
    <string _locid="162347">Commandery</string>
    <string _locid="162348">The Commandery is a unique Maltese fortification that is available starting in the Commerce Age. Functionally, it serves not only as a stronger Outpost, including its role as a Home City shipment arrival point, but also as a training site for certain units that are typically only available to other civilizations. Certain Home City cards can improve the accessibility of these units.</string>
    <string _locid="162349">A commandery was the term for the headquarters of any stronghold or city controlled by a knightly military order, where the commanding officer and his knights presided over local affairs. Commanderies ranged in structure from large estate houses to fortified citadels, and were spread all over Europe by the later medieval period. As knightly orders declined and gradually became obsolete, commanderies were often ceded to or seized by the states in which they lay, becoming property of that polity and abolishing the order’s chapter there.</string>
    <string _locid="162350">Fixed Gun</string>
    <string _locid="162351">The Fixed Gun is a unique Maltese fortification that is available starting in the Fortress Age. While strong against buildings and most units, it has a minimum range that necessitates it being guarded, and is especially weak against anti-artillery units such as Culverins.</string>
    <string _locid="162352">As the early modern period brought more powerful weaponry and technology, innovations were made offensively as well as defensively. One such development was the use of fixed artillery pieces, which primarily had a defensive role. Although immobile, their strong firepower made them deadly against soldiers and ships alike – and, of course, to any buildings in the vicinity. However, their lack of mobility was also a crucial weakness; they were difficult, if not impossible to portage, and prone to capture if not properly defended.</string>
    <string _locid="162353">Hospital</string>
    <string _locid="162354">The Hospital is a unique Maltese building that is available starting in the Commerce Age. Like the Barracks that it replaces, it trains various military units, but it also heals nearby units like a Field Hospital.</string>
    <string _locid="162355">The Knights Hospitaller had their origins as a knightly order that maintained the Hospital of St. John in Jerusalem during the Crusades. Over time, the Order became increasingly militarized out of necessity, but retained its charitable mission as guardian of hospitals for pilgrims – thus developing a hybrid character.</string>
    <string _locid="162356">Depot</string>
    <string _locid="162357">The Depot is a unique Maltese building that is available starting in the Commerce Age. It boosts the attack rate of nearby gunpowder units. Upon destruction, it explodes, damaging allied and enemy units alike. It can only self-destruct after a short delay.</string>
    <string _locid="162358">A depot is a storage building holding all manner of military supplies: weapons, ammunition, medical supplies, uniforms, food, and other such necessities. Armies erected these in order to be able to resupply themselves when necessary and prevent the items within from perishing. The Knights Hospitaller gradually adopted more advanced technology to compensate for a lack of manpower, and used it to great effect – but also occasionally suffered the consequences of experimenting with such dangerous materials.</string>
    <string _locid="162359">Order Galley</string>
    <string _locid="162360">The Order Galley is a unique Maltese warship that is available starting in the Commerce Age. It is similar to the Ottoman Galley, but is both heavier and more expensive. Order Galleys regenerate hit points and can ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their damage output and range.</string>
    <string _locid="162361">While oceangoing vessels were tailored to the formidable currents and unpredictable conditions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and other larger oceans, the calmer waters of the Mediterranean Sea demanded different emphases: speed, maneuverability, and even integrity to withstand ramming other ships. These galleys, the descendants of the warships of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, were mainstays in the conflicts between European states and the Ottoman Empire. Their most famous usage was at the 1571 Battle of Lepanto, but they were versatile beyond pitched battle. The Knights Hospitaller of Malta organized the so-called “corso”, which was designed for the dual purpose of protecting trade routes against piracy and raiding rival shipping enterprises. The term carried such gravity that it was even variously applied over time to smaller units of the system or even individual figures.</string>
    <string _locid="162362">Fire Thrower</string>
    <string _locid="162363">The Fire Thrower replaces the Grenadier and is unique to the Maltese. It is a heavy ranged infantry and siege unit that can be trained at the Artillery Foundry starting in the Commerce Age. Fire Throwers hurl flaming hoops that inflict area damage as well as burning damage that gradually affects units struck by its projectiles. Over time, they can be equipped with flamethrowers and rocket throwers.</string>
    <string _locid="162364">Fire Throwers are an early, short-ranged infantry unit that operates like artillery. They are the first unit available that does very good damage to buildings. They are a little faster than proper artillery, but still slower than regular infantry.\n \nHistory:\n \nDuring the Siege of Malta in 1565, the defenders of Malta (the Knights of St. John) relied heavily on incendiary weapons, including ones called the "firework hoop." These weapons, made of gunpowder and wood, were used against advancing Janissaries as they attempted to storm Fort St. Elmo. The incendiary weapons were highly effective, forcing the Janissaries to fall back from their attack. Approximately 2,000 elite Janissaries were killed during the assault on Fort St. Elmo, while only about eighty of their enemy died. After the siege the Knights of St. John, also known as the Knights Hospitaller, controlled Malta until 1798.</string>
    <string _locid="162365">Grand Master</string>
    <string _locid="162366">The Grand Master replaces the Explorer and is unique to the Maltese. Like the Explorer, the Grand Master is a ranged infantry hero that can collect Treasures, construct certain buildings, is effective against Treasure Guardians, and can utilize the Sharpshooter ability to kill individual enemy units. Grand Masters also construct special buildings for the Maltese, like Forts, Fixed Guns and Gunpowder Depots.</string>
    <string _locid="162367">Knightly military orders had one supreme commander, the Grand Master, who was elected from among the senior officers in the order’s ranks whenever the presiding Grand Master died or otherwise forfeited his office, resided in the order’s headquarters, and had full command of all of the order’s assets. He was, in essence, an autocrat. One prominent example within the Knights of Malta was Jean Parisot de la Valette (1490s-1568), who famously led the Maltese defense during the Ottoman Siege of Malta in 1565.</string>
    <string _locid="162368">Sentinel</string>
    <string _locid="162369">The Sentinel replaces the Musketeer and is unique to the Maltese. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and is adept on defense, gaining strength when positioned near buildings owned by the same player. It has better hit points and armor than standard Musketeers at the cost of two population slots as well as lower speed and range. When engaged by melee units, it will switch to a polearm.</string>
    <string _locid="162370">Owing to their position on the frontier against a powerful adversary in the Ottoman Empire, the Knights of Malta were often forced to adopt primarily defensive tactics. Their troops were expert at defensive operations and well-equipped for such tasks – most notably, in 1565, a small Maltese defense force commanded by the Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette repelled a vastly numerically superior Ottoman force at the Siege of Malta. The early modern period saw the introduction of more advanced firearms into armies, but for centuries soldiers still retained the melee weapons of the prior era, which remained reliable and trusty when in a pinch.</string>
    <string _locid="162371">Hospitaller</string>
    <string _locid="162372">The Hospitaller is a unique Maltese heavy hand infantry unit that replaces the Halberdier. It is available at the Hospital starting in the Commerce Age and can be trained at the Hospital. Hospitallers have high hit points and attack values, and can deflect or absorb a portion of damage from attacks targeting adjacent allied units.</string>
    <string _locid="162373">The Hospitallers were originally a knightly order founded in Jerusalem during the Crusades. They derived the byname from their association with the hospital of St. John in Jerusalem, and grew over time to become one of the most prominent Christian knightly orders. However, as their holdings in the Holy Land and eastern Mediterranean were gradually pried away, their power faded. However, they experienced a resurgence in 1530 when they were granted the island of Malta, which they held despite numerous invasions until 1798. Hospitaller soldiers were famed for their bravery, piety, and steadfast loyalty to the order which they served.</string>
    <string _locid="162374">Giant Grenadier</string>
    <string _locid="162375">The Giant Grenadier is a mercenary heavy ranged infantry unit. Giant Grenadiers are stout units with a high damage output. They have three main attack modes: a ranged musket that deals splash damage, a melee attack that is effective against cavalry, and grenades which they use against buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="162376">The 17th-18th century Prussian Emperor Friedrich Wilhelm I had a peculiar obsession with tall men, and set about recruiting them from far and wide into a special regiment. This squad, colloquially known as the Potsdam Giants, became an elite group of line infantry. On several occasions, the Emperor even received tall men from neighboring nations for his private army as a diplomatic overture, and even attempted to breed them with tall women to create more giant soldiers. After Friedrich Wilhelm’s death in 1740, his son Friedrich the Great discontinued the practice and gradually incorporated the Giants into other, more standardized regiments.</string>
    <string _locid="162377">Pandour</string>
    <string _locid="162378">The Pandour is a mercenary ranged infantry unit. Pandours are not the most durable units, but they are speedy, have a resistance against ranged attacks, and can enter Stealth mode, making them excellent raiders. Like a Skirmisher, they attack their enemies with a rifle from range, but in contrast they are more effective against ranged infantry than heavy infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="162379">The Pandours were light infantrymen of the Hungarian military during the 18th century, generally drawn from Slavic border regions, especially Croatia. While effective, they were undisciplined, and tended to rely on a reputation for ferocity and individual prowess in combat, making them useful tools at times and a hindrance to military cohesion in others. In an effort to mitigate the latter issue, the Habsburgs imprisoned their commander, the troublesome Baron von der Trenck, and modified their structure so as to become more manageable – yet their fearsome reputation remained.</string>
    <string _locid="162380">Royal Horseman</string>
    <string _locid="162381">The Royal Horseman is a heavy hand cavalry mercenary. Royal Horsemen are powerful, durable units that inflict trample damage on adjacent enemy units. They also utilize a melee attack with a large area of effect.</string>
    <string _locid="162382">As the opulence and military prowess of early-modern European states increased, several monarchs and other magnates equipped ‘gardes du corps’ – personal bodyguards, usually consisting of elite cavalry. While these gradually became increasingly widespread, those in France and the German states developed an especially fearsome reputation. Heavy cavalry remained effective in battle, whether as a shock force, when executing cleverly timed tactical maneuvers, or merely when protecting their ruler, but there was a darker side to them as well – they were often sent to literally trample unruly subjects in instances of civil unrest.</string>
    <string _locid="162383">Mounted Rifleman</string>
    <string _locid="162384">The Mounted Rifleman is a heavy ranged cavalry mercenary. Mounted Riflemen are not especially durable, but compensate with high range and damage. They are particularly effective against infantry, but vulnerable to light ranged cavalry such as Dragoons.</string>
    <string _locid="162385">The French Chasseurs – ‘Hunters’ – were experimental regiments, usually mounted, that were equipped in the aftermath of the French Revolution and swiftly became favorites of Napoleon Bonaparte. They saw distinguished action during the Napoleonic Wars, whether as the personal guard of the emperor, or in decisive maneuvers in combat, but suffered significantly from attrition as the conflict wore on. After Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo in 1815, these regiments ceased to exist.</string>
    <string _locid="162386">Armored Pistoleer</string>
    <string _locid="162387">The Armored Pistoleer is a heavy ranged infantry mercenary. Armored Pistoleers are formidable units with high hit points, armor, and attack values. When attacking from range, its pistol deals splash damage to enemy units near the one that is hit. Armored Pistoleers also will tank some of the damage that would otherwise be dealt to nearby allied units.</string>
    <string _locid="162388">During the early-modern period, one military innovation made by Franco-Italian states in particular was the use of dismounted elite infantry in instances where fighting on foot was preferable to being astride a horse. One such group, the Savoyard cuirassiers, flourished during the 17th century, fighting in full plate armor while wielding pistols and swords. The sight of these troops, particularly their peculiar burgonet helms – which resembled an otherworldly face – struck fear into even the most hardened adversaries.</string>
    <string _locid="162389">Irish Brigadier</string>
    <string _locid="162390">The Irish Brigadier is a heavy ranged infantry mercenary. Like Highlanders and Fusiliers, Irish Brigadiers wield a musket as their primary weapon, but are less expensive and have lower hit points. Their ranged attack is more than respectable, but their melee attack is formidable as well, including a small bonus against cavalry. Irish Brigadiers also can ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their hit points and attack.</string>
    <string _locid="162391">Though formidable fighters in their homeland, Irish troops were perhaps most renowned for their service as mercenaries in foreign conflicts, such as the 17th century so-called Flight of the Wild Geese. Although they most commonly served in French and Spanish armies, they also played a distinguished role in the Mexican-American War of 1846-48, where the San Patricios (St. Patrick’s Battalion) fought for the Mexicans and were by all accounts their strongest unit in the conflict. Such was their prowess (and the attractiveness of their incentives) that many American troops even defected to join them.</string>
    <string _locid="162392">Bosniak</string>
    <string _locid="162393">The Bosniak is a heavy hand cavalry mercenary. Bosniaks are lancers that are comparable to Stradiots, but unlike them, have multipliers on their damage output – making them more of a hard counter than a soft counter to the units against whom heavy cavalry excel. They also have a slightly longer range than other melee cavalry units, making it easier for them to attack their targets, as well a unique attribute: a special lance attack that charges up over time. Bosniaks can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their hit points and attack.</string>
    <string _locid="162394">Although nominally from Bosnia, Bosniaks were in reality drawn from all over Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans. These units served as irregular cavalry in other European armies, most notably those of Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Flourishing during the 18th century, especially during the Seven Years’ War, Bosniak cavalry could immediately be recognized by their distinct hats and black uniforms with white and colored ornaments.</string>
    <string _locid="162395">Battleship</string>
    <string _locid="162396">The Battleship is a mercenary warship, one of the heaviest in the game. It is available at the Dock starting in the Commerce Age to any player who has allied with a European Royal House by building a Trading Post at one of their palaces. Some European civilizations can also access Battleships through Home City shipments. Sporting 18 guns, it has a high rate of fire.</string>
    <string _locid="162397">During the 17th-19th centuries, naval tactics evolved towards a heavy reliance on broadside bombardments. This led warship construction to favor larger vessels with more cannons and greater integrity. The pinnacle of this development was the ship of the line, so named for the “line”, a broadside tactic. These early battleships ruled the seas in their heyday, but were gradually superseded by ironclad frigates during the later part of the 19th century.</string>
    <string _locid="162398">European Royal Houses</string>
    <string _locid="162399">Representing larger entities whose influence transcended national borders rather than individual people-groups, European Royal Houses thematically blur the lines between major and minor civilizations in Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition. Like Native American Settlements, Asian Holy Sites, and African Kingdoms, a Trading Post must be built on European Royal Houses’ Palaces to ally with them. Royal Houses provide a unique ability and more units and technologies on average than other minor civilizations, but these are staggered across multiple ages rather than being available in the Exploration Age. These assets are quite impactful and the units often utilize novel mechanics – such as unit promotions, charged actions, (dis)mounting, and damage deflection – but tend to come at a higher cost than their counterparts.</string>
    <string _locid="162400">House of Bourbon</string>
    <string _locid="162401">Originating out of the French House of Capet in the 10th century the House of Bourbon would emerge one of the preeminent royal families of Western Europe by the 1500s. At its height, the house had lineages in France, Spain, and Italy. Accumulating wealth and clout through several key engagements throughout France, the Bourbons eventually reached their apex under the reign of King Louis XIV, widely considered the greatest monarch in French history. His rule was renowned for its military proactivity, record-setting longevity (72 years on the throne), and royal opulence, emblemized by the world-famous Palace of Versailles.\n\nIn an era of globe-spanning imperial developments, the Bourbons were notable for their heavy centralization of royal power. To keep their ever-growing holdings under more direct supervision, they passed a series of sweeping reforms in the early 1700s. These policies, however, would prove extremely controversial during the following generations, eventually culminating in the French Revolution in 1789.</string>
    <string _locid="162402">House of Habsburg</string>
    <string _locid="162403">The Habsburgs were the engine driving the imperialist ambitions of much of Western Europe in the early modern era. From its humble roots in the southern reaches of the Holy Roman Empire, the Habsburgs would reach its breakthrough with the ascent of Charles V to the thrones of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. Channeling his vast of wealth and political connections accrued from the Duchy of Burgundy, Charles set the precedent of a universal monarchy, wherein a multinational congress would serve a rigid central authority figure.\n\nDespite only partially realizing his lofty dreams in his lifetime, Charles V left a permanent imprint on the Habsburg dynasty during the centuries following his death. Under the reign of King Ferdinand on, a newly united Spain would quickly carve a vast dominion throughout most of Central and South America. Further to the east, the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary would fall under Habsburg persuasion. Through this solid coalition, the Habsburg Crown Lands were a bulwark against the aggressive expansionist campaigns of the Ottoman Empire, climaxing at the second Siege of Vienna in 1683. In 1713, Charles VI of the Holy Roman Empire issued the Pragmatic Sanction, an edict that reaffirmed the Habsburg territories as an indivisible nation state. The Habsburg royal family would continue to dominate European politics until the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the 20th century.</string>
    <string _locid="162404">House of Hanover</string>
    <string _locid="162405">The House of Hanover can trace its origins back to the prestigious German families of Brunswick and Welf, the latter of which produced the influential Henry the Lion during the 1100s. These families' steady rise over the coming centuries eventually culminated in the elector George I becoming head of the British monarchy, a connection which would result in the most prestigious period in British history. Through their network of benefits as part of the Holy Roman Empire, including a key alliance with the Prussians, the Hanoverians transformed Britain into the world’s leading superpower that would reach its apex by the Victorian Era, a period sometimes referred to as Pax Britannica, for the record-shattering size of the British Empire during the long reign of Queen Victoria. The combined German Legion and British Army saw generations of great military victories, most notably the Battle of Waterloo of 1815, in which the renowned Royal Scots Greys cavalry led a decisive charge that put an end to the ambitions of Napoleon. Reaping the lucrative benefits of their partnership, the Hanoverians ultimately developed their own kingdom following the demise of the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 1800s and would rule much of their native Germany for several decades.\n\nDespite–and indeed as a result of–producing the largest maritime empire in world history, the unique relationship between the Hanoverians and the British also contributed to the divestment of British royal powers in favor of a constitutional monarchy, setting the precedent for the decentralized system of politics that dominates most of Europe today.</string>
    <string _locid="162406">House of Jagiellon</string>
    <string _locid="162407">Following the defeat of the Teutonic Order against a united Polish-Lithuanian army at the Battle of Grunwald, the House of Jagiellon emerged one of the leading arbiters of events throughout Eastern Europe at the dawn of the modern era. Having been born out of the union of the pagan Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila (later rechristened Władysław II Jagiełło) and the Roman Catholic Queen of Poland Jadwiga, the House of Jagiellon understood that to survive the threat of their powerful neighbors, disparate polities would have to unite under a common cause. This close relationship between Poland and Lithuania would eventually culminate in the Union of Lublin, which established a Commonwealth between the two kingdoms that would continue to rule the region for several generations after the house’s demise shortly thereafter.\n\nThroughout their existence, the Jagiellons oversaw the development of a multicultural society marked by religious toleration and decentralized rule. Turning to the west for inspiration, the Jagiellon dynasty would make contact with the royal lineages of Hungary and Bohemia, unions which would prove fruitful in the ensuing centuries. Through these connections, the Jagiellons imported ideals of the Renaissance and fostered their spread throughout their core domains. The Jagiellonian University in Kraków is one of the oldest and most prestigious centers of learning throughout Europe and a catalyst for the Polish Golden Age of the 1500s.</string>
    <string _locid="162408">House of Oldenburg</string>
    <string _locid="162409">The Northern German House of Oldenburg has ruled the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway since the mid-15th century. Since their inception they have established several precedents that have forged a collective Scandinavian identity. Though the house was particularly prominent in Denmark, the Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp cadet branch made several powerful inroads throughout Scandinavia and its peripheries. Through its linkage to the Russian House of Romanov, its power stretched deep into Siberia.\n\nThe Oldenburgs adopted several reforms that established the framework of Northern European commerce. Tolls from the Oresund Customs House provided over half of Denmark’s total income, allowing it to establish a firm hand in administrative affairs throughout the Baltic region. In 1783, facing the disruption of transatlantic trade by the belligerent Royal Navy of Britain, the House of Oldenburg established the League of Armed Neutrality, which aimed to protect neutral shipping during wartime.</string>
    <string _locid="162410">Houses of Phanar</string>
    <string _locid="162411">Following the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, the noble families of Phanar, known collectively as the Phanariotes, became the preeminent liaisons between the Turkish sultan and his Greek subjects. Originating from the culturally preeminent Fener district of Constantinople, the Phanariotes exploited the inner-workings of the Ottoman establishment to inherit some of its most prominent posts. Many Phanariote families such as the Ghicas and Mavrocordatos sought governorships throughout the relatively autonomous realms of Wallachia and Moldavia, where they collected taxes and expanded their political clout.\n\nHighly educated and politically flexible, the Phanariotes were instrumental in the Ottomans' negotiations with European powers and played a key role in establishing contact between Western Europe and the Ottomans' Christian subjects. By the time of the Greek Revolution, they had developed extensive connections with the British, Russians, and French, which came to influence Greek politics following the decline of Ottoman hegemony. The Phanariote major general Alexander Ypsilantis, a key proponent of the Greek Revolution, became one of Russia’s leading officers during the Napoleonic Wars.</string>
    <string _locid="162412">House of Vasa</string>
    <string _locid="162413">The House of Vasa experienced one of the most turbulent existences of the pre-modern era throughout its short presence. When the Catholic King of Poland Sigismund III inherited the Swedish throne in 1592, a dynastic conflict erupted between members of the house, as Sweden by then was predominantly Protestant. Compounding matters was Poland’s recently adopted system of Golden Liberty, which ensured egalitarian privileges to the szlachta noble class, granting them disproportionate influence over the house’s policies. Following the brief-lived Polish-Swedish union, Sweden came under the rule of the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach, which, in tandem with Russia, declared war on the Polonized Vasas in the Deluge.\n\nBy the 1600s, the House of Vasa found itself at the heart of the infamous Thirty Years' War with the Holy Roman Empire. Amidst this conflict, the streak of military successes and sociocultural achievements of King Gustavus Adolpus of Sweden earned him the nickname “the Lion of the North” and laid much of the foundation of modern Swedish national pride.</string>
    <string _locid="162414">House of Wettin</string>
    <string _locid="162415">The House of Wettin, derived from its claimed link to the Saxon chief Wittekind, holds a legacy that spans over a thousand years. Following generations of accumulated clout in the Holy Roman Empire, the Wettins were some of the empire’s greatest proponents by the time they were split into the Ernestine and Albertine branches in 1485. In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, the Wettins were able to establish the independent Kingdom of Saxony, which thrived for a century.\n\nBoth the Ernestine and Albertine lines produced important figures whose legacy is still felt both within and beyond the house’s Saxon homelands. The Albertine elector Augustus II the Strong went on to become King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, not only inheriting a huge territory, but also undertaking major renovation projects in the cities of Dresden and Kraków.  The Ernestines reached their apex beginning in the 19th and 20 centuries, when the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha branch married into royal families as far away as Belgium and Portugal, eventually earning it the nickname “the stud of Europe”.</string>
    <string _locid="162416">House of Wittelsbach</string>
    <string _locid="162417">The Wittelsbachs emerged the dominant ruling family of Bavaria in the late 1100s and played a heavy hand in the region for several centuries. As their prestige grew, they extended their influence far across Europe: south into Greece, west into Britain, and north into Scandinavia. In Sweden, Kings Charles XI and II were renowned for the development of the Carolean army, which employed innovative tactics to score several military victories against opponents that far outnumbered them. Following the dissolution of the house’s Bavarian branch in 1777, its Palatine branch assumed control in its absence. In the 1800s, the House of Wittelsbach ruled the Kingdom of Bavaria, one of the most preeminent polities of the German-speaking world. They would remain in power until the end of World War I in 1918.\n\nThe Wittelsbachs were well-known for their regal splendor. The Bavarian King Ludwig II commissioned the construction of the world-famous Neuschwanstein Castle, a monument so fabulous that it contributed to his reputation as the “Swan King”.</string>
    <string _locid="162418">Saxon Cuirassier</string>
    <string _locid="162419">The Saxon Cuirassier is a heavy hand cavalry unit. It is available in the Fortress Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Wettin by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Like French Cuirassiers, Saxon Cuirassiers have high hit points, deal area damage in melee, and are effective against a wide variety of units, but to lesser degrees. Unlike French Cuirassiers, Saxon Cuirassiers take up no population slots but, like other Trading Post units, have a build limit.</string>
    <string _locid="162420">The House of Wettin ruled German Saxony (among other territories) from the medieval period up through the 20th century. Although armored heavy cavalry had gradually gone out of fashion, it saw a resurgence during the Napoleonic Wars, when the French Grande Armee used them to deadly effect. The Saxons, who allied with the French, contributed three regiments of elite cuirassier cavalry to that army, and they were held in high regard due to their distinguished role in combat.</string>
    <string _locid="162421">Saxon Trabant</string>
    <string _locid="162422">The Saxon Trabant is a heavy infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Wettin by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Like the Italian Papal Guard, Saxon Trabants are stout units that can deflect a portion of damage from attacks targeting adjacent allied units, and can also use a powerful charged pistol attack against enemy units.</string>
    <string _locid="162423">The House of Wettin ruled German Saxony (among other territories) from the medieval period up through the 20th century. Trabants, deriving from German traben, ‘to walk’, were elite guards who fought on foot instead of from horseback and became mainstays in prestigious European households, where they literally shielded their rulers from attacks. Trabants saw notable action in Saxon armies from the 17th century on through the Napoleonic Wars, where, serving the French, they were wiped out during the Grande Armee’s invasion of Russia in 1812.</string>
    <string _locid="162424">Royal Musketeer</string>
    <string _locid="162425">The Royal Musketeer is a ranged heavy infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Bourbon by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Royal Musketeers carry muskets but can use a powerful charged pistol attack against enemy units, while in melee combat they will rely on a fast attack with a rapier and have a small bonus against cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162426">The House of Bourbon ruled much of France and the surrounding regions from the medieval period up through the 19th century. Royal musketeers, made most famous by Alexandre Dumas’ ‘The Three Musketeers’, a depiction of 17th century musketeers, actually served as elite units for the king. In fact, several of the characters in the novel are based on historical figures. As the French Revolution dismantled the French monarchy, the musketeers went in and out of fashion, finally seeing their end at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars.</string>
    <string _locid="162427">Winged Hussar</string>
    <string _locid="162428">The Winged Hussar is a heavy hand cavalry unit. It is available in the Fortress Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Vasa by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Winged Hussars are swift heavy lancer units who deal directional area of effect damage (i.e. units directly behind the main target will be damaged as well).</string>
    <string _locid="162429">The House of Vasa ruled Sweden and much of Poland during the 16th and 17th centuries. During this time, medium cavalry called hussars dominated battlefields in Central and Eastern Europe. Although originally borrowed from regiments in Hungarian armies, the hussars of Poland became the most notable variant for their prowess on the battlefield and their flamboyant attire. Charging into battle with formidable armor and wings attached to them that created an ominous rattling sound, these horsemen struck fear into even the most hardened armies of the time.</string>
    <string _locid="162430">Royal Arquebusier</string>
    <string _locid="162431">The Royal Arquebusier is a ranged infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Vasa by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Royal Arquebusiers are cost-efficient units that are more durable and adept in melee combat than normal Skirmishers, but less powerful at range.</string>
    <string _locid="162432">The House of Vasa ruled Sweden and much of Poland during the 16th and 17th centuries. When engaged in the Thirty Years’ War (1618-48), Gustavus Adolphus assembled an army that he diligently trained himself, using innovative tactics to compete with the larger and better-equipped armies of his adversaries. The royal arquebusiers were one component of this combined arms force, and they helped engineer groundbreaking victories at battles such as Breitenfeld and River Lech.</string>
    <string _locid="162433">Royal Hunter</string>
    <string _locid="162434">The Royal Hunter is a ranged infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Oldenburg by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Royal Hunters counter Skirmishers, can fire at deer to drive them in a certain direction without killing them, gather from hunted animals and pick up Treasures.</string>
    <string _locid="162435">The House of Oldenburg ruled parts of northern Germany, Denmark, and the surrounding regions from the medieval period through the 20th century. During the early modern period, this faction’s territories were generally northerly ones with a long tradition of hunting – which made many of its people deadly accurate with a firearm, and thus effective both in the hunt and in battle.</string>
    <string _locid="162436">Northern Musketeer</string>
    <string _locid="162437">The Northern Musketeer is a ranged heavy infantry unit. It is available in the Fortress Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Oldenburg by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Northern Musketeers are cost-efficient units that compensate for low durability with high damage as well as bonuses against cavalry in both ranged and melee combat. Northern Musketeers can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their hit points and thus increasing their durability.</string>
    <string _locid="162438">The House of Oldenburg ruled parts of northern Germany, Denmark, and the surrounding regions from the medieval period through the 20th century. During the 19th century in particular, the Oldenburgs drafted significant forces of infantry from Scandinavia and Russia. These troops were often poorly equipped, trained, and supplied, but compensated for it with immense bravery, often resulting in tragically costly assaults.</string>
    <string _locid="162439">Evzone</string>
    <string _locid="162440">The Evzone is a ranged infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the Houses of Phanar by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Evzones are swift units with low base attack but high damage multipliers against heavy infantry, and are also moderately effective against light cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162441">The Houses of Phanar held considerable influence in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans from the 16th century through the 19th century. During the Greek War of Independence (1821-29), units of evzones (so named for their prestigious traditional attire) rose to prominence, eventually becoming a mainstay in Greek armies. Evzones were known for their aesthetic (the fustanella kilt being especially peculiar for armies of the time), bravery, loyalty, and ferocity.</string>
    <string _locid="162442">Mountain Trooper</string>
    <string _locid="162443">The Mountain Trooper is a ranged infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Wittelsbach by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Mountain Troopers are functionally similar to Skirmishers, but have a unique attribute: any unit hit by a Mountain Trooper will temporarily reveal its line of sight. Mountain Troopers can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their range and rate of fire.</string>
    <string _locid="162444">The House of Wittelsbach ruled Bavaria from the medieval period up through the 20th century. Holding a significant amount of territory in the Alpine region, it drew on the people there when fielding portions of its armies. Alpine troops were excellent marksmen with a longstanding tradition of experienced hunting and mountain navigation techniques. Uniquely for many troops of the time, they often used horns for communication when many armies had moved onto newer instruments or techniques.</string>
    <string _locid="162445">Bavarian Chevauleger</string>
    <string _locid="162446">The Bavarian Chevauleger is a ranged light cavalry unit. It is available in the Fortress Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Wittelsbach by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Bavarian Chevaulegers, despite their name, were in reality more medium cavalry than light cavalry. They combine the relatively high hit points of a Hussar with the speed and combat roles of a Dragoon.</string>
    <string _locid="162447">The House of Wittelsbach ruled Bavaria from the medieval period up through the 20th century. As the early modern period wore on, heavy cavalry were found to be increasingly less utile and were gradually supplanted by medium cavalry such as chevaulegers, which variously included hand cavalry wielding swords and lances. The Bavarian variant, however, tended to prefer swords or sabers, and remained in use even beyond the Napoleonic Wars.</string>
    <string _locid="162448">Totenkopf Hussar</string>
    <string _locid="162449">The Totenkopf Hussar is a heavy hand cavalry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Hanover by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Totenkopf Hussars are similar to Hussars, but have a special attribute, the Death Strike, which is a powerful attack that charges up while a Totenkopf Hussar is fighting. Totenkopf Hussars can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their hit points and attack speed.</string>
    <string _locid="162450">The House of Hanover ruled much of northwestern Germany from the 17th century up through the 20th century. During the early modern period, northern German states such as Hanover and Prussia recruited elite heavy cavalry forces. The Hanoverians, who often fought in the service of the Prussians, led, among other troops, Brunswicker cavalry dubbed Totenkopf Hussars for the insignia of the skull and crossbones that they wore on their hats. These troops were of such repute in their heyday that they spawned several imitations in the armies of their contemporaries, such as France, Sweden, and even Chile.</string>
    <string _locid="162451">Drummer</string>
    <string _locid="162452">The Drummer is an infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Hanover by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Drummers are unconventional units whose main role is not as fighters – even though they can attack with a pistol – but in improving the speed of nearby allied units. Drummers also gain additional hit points when close to allied units, making them hard to kill when in the midst of an army.</string>
    <string _locid="162453">The House of Hanover ruled much of northwestern Germany from the 17th century up through the 20th century. However, a branch of this house also ruled in England for a few centuries. British armies were among many in Europe to make use of drummers in their armies to pace troop movement and communicate commands with various rhythms and sequences. Drummers were crucial to forces for this reason – and often became targets as a result.</string>
    <string _locid="162454">Black Brunswicker</string>
    <string _locid="162455">The Black Brunswicker is a ranged heavy infantry unit. It is available in the Fortress Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Hanover by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Black Brunswickers are similar to Musketeers, with a bonus against cavalry, but have speedier movement and reloading time at the expense of lower hit points. Black Brunswickers can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their hit points and damage.</string>
    <string _locid="162456">The House of Hanover ruled much of northwestern Germany from the 17th century up through the 20th century. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg recruited an elite force in opposition to French occupation of parts of Germany. This force’s black uniforms lent themselves to their colloquial name, the ‘Black Brunswickers’. They became known as a force to be feared during Napoleon’s invasion of Spain, but persisted as a deadly force through the remainder of the war and beyond, their insignia of the skull and crossbones heralding the impending doom of their enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="162457">Line Infantry</string>
    <string _locid="162458">The Line Infantry is a ranged heavy infantry unit. It is available in the Fortress Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Habsburg by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Line Infantry are functionally similar to Musketeers, but derive separate benefits – such as additional attack, range, or armor – depending on the stance that they utilize. Line Infantry can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their hit points and damage.</string>
    <string _locid="162459">The House of Habsburg ruled much of Austria, Central Europe, and even occasionally Iberia and Mexico from the medieval period up through the 20th century. During the early-modern period, several tacticians – most notably Gustavus Adolphus – departed from the existing standards of engagement and innovated. The result was a system where tightly-packed lines of firearm-bearing troops fired a series of volleys at their adversaries. Although effective in an open field, they were not without weaknesses, and any sort of combat on rough or dense terrain or against irregular combatants put them at a disadvantage.</string>
    <string _locid="162460">Mounted Infantry</string>
    <string _locid="162461">The Mounted Infantry is a unit that can be utilized in two forms: a ranged heavy cavalry unit, and a ranged infantry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Habsburg by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Mounted Infantry have small bonuses against heavy infantry and light cavalry, and can mount and dismount to utilize different benefits – although they are briefly vulnerable while doing so. While the dismounted version of the unit has greater range and bonus damage, the mounted version has more hit points and speed. Both can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their range and speed.</string>
    <string _locid="162462">The House of Habsburg ruled much of Austria, Central Europe, and even occasionally Iberia and Mexico from the medieval period up through the 20th century. During the early-modern period, the formerly cavalry-dominated battlefield transformed into an infantry-dominated one, leading to an increase in the use of mounted infantry: units that rode to the battlefield before dismounting and fighting on foot, affording them organizational and defensive advantages. This versatility made them an important component of any army in which they served.</string>
    <string _locid="162463">Lipka Tatar</string>
    <string _locid="162464">The Lipka Tatar is a ranged light cavalry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Jagiellon by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Lipka Tatars are quick-firing bowmen who utilize a swift sabre attack in melee combat, but their melee and ranged attacks both have less bonus damage against cavalry than those of many other light cavalry units.</string>
    <string _locid="162465">The House of Jagiellon ruled Poland and much of the surrounding territories during the 14th-16th centuries. Prior to and during this time, the turbulence in the lands of the Golden Horde caused another sequence of migrations as the Horde suffered defeats at the hands of its neighbors or expelled rebellious factions. One of these migratory groups, the Lipka Tatars, first entered Lithuania (later Poland-Lithuania) during the 14th century and were granted land and asylum by its lords in exchange for fealty and military service. Lipka Tatars proved to be invaluable auxiliary forces in Polish-Lithuanian armies, playing decisive roles in battles such as Grunwald-Tannenberg in 1410 and Vienna in 1683.</string>
    <string _locid="162466">Shock Rider</string>
    <string _locid="162467">The Shock Rider is a heavy hand cavalry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Jagiellon by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Shock Riders utilize a lance and can use a charged attack that regenerates over time. While they have low base hit points, their dual ranged and melee armor makes them versatile. Shock Riders can also ascend up to three levels of promotions by killing enemy units, each level raising their hit points and attack speed.</string>
    <string _locid="162468">The House of Jagiellon ruled Poland and much of the surrounding territories during the 14th-16th centuries. During the 15th century, Central and Eastern European states began to make use of Balkan cavalry auxiliaries in larger quantities following the example of the Hungarian monarch Matthias Corvinus (15th century), whose Huszars were of such repute that they directly influenced the predecessors of the Winged Hussars in Poland. Generally wielding lances and shields, these cavalry were famed for their intrepid bravery, versatility, and efficiency on the battlefield, whether they were used in opening shock charges or in clever tactical maneuvers.</string>
    <string _locid="162469">Crabat</string>
    <string _locid="162470">The Crabat is a light cavalry outlaw unit available at the Saloon, Tavern, and Monastery beginning in the Commerce Age. Despite their poor hitpoints and range, they are agile units with excellent attack and solid siege abilities. Their hitpoints and rate of fire improve with extensive use.</string>
    <string _locid="162471">During the European-Ottoman wars of the 16th century, light skirmishing cavalry from the Balkans began to cultivate a formidable reputation. By the 17th century, a particular variant of these, known as the Crabats (derived from the Slavic Croats), saw widespread action in conflicts across all of Europe, most prominently during the Thirty Years' War. Their combined use of sabres and pistols made them versatile combatants who could inflict serious damage in short and efficient intervals. Initially deployed by the Habsburg monarchy, Crabats would also form the basis of King Louis XIV of France’s Royal Cravates. Crabats are particularly famous for their iconic knotted neck ties, from which the popular fashion item the cravat originates.</string>
    <string _locid="162472">Hajduk</string>
    <string _locid="162473">The Hajduk is a ranged infantry outlaw unit that may be hired at the Tavern, Saloon, or Monastery beginning in the Commerce Age. It gets a large attack bonus against skirmishers and a small boost against other infantry units. It also has veterancy for hitpoints and damage.</string>
    <string _locid="162474">Hajduks were typical bandits and brigands who inhabited much of the Balkans during the Ottoman occupation of the 17th through 19th centuries. They occasionally served as mercenaries to the nearby Habsburgs, especially as part of the Military Frontier by the Ottoman border. Hajduk activity was predominantly motivated by the harsh taxes and religious persecution carried out under the Ottoman leaders, and as such, their targets were mostly Ottoman authority figures and aristocrats that benefited from their policies. This Robin Hood-style morality contributed to the romanticization of Hajduks as Christian freedom fighters battling Ottoman oppression. Despite their guerrilla-style combat tactics, bands of Hajduks adhered to a hierarchical system. The Serbian leader Karađorđe spent his early military career as a Hajduk and later applied his experience while spearheading the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottomans.</string>
    <string _locid="162475">Highwayman</string>
    <string _locid="162476">The Highwayman is an outlaw unit available at the Tavern, Saloon, and Monastery from the Commerce Age onwards. It fires two pistols with a small anti-cavalry bonus while dismounted and uses a single pistol with a larger anti-cavalry attack bonus while mounted. It also has access to a powerful charged rifle attack, as well as a powerful sword during melee combat.</string>
    <string _locid="162477">In early modern Europe, brigands came from various backgrounds. While some were mere groups of bandits, others were the dying remnants of unsuccessful movements against unpopular government. In isolated, poorly administered areas, highwaymen, deprived of basic necessities, would prey upon helpless travelers by extorting them for money, typically by force. Occasionally, these resulted in targeted assassinations. Though typically seen as only a petty nuisance, the threat of brigandage would occasionally factor into the evolution of government reform, such as the unification of Italy in the 1860s.</string>
    <string _locid="162478">Inquisitor</string>
    <string _locid="162479">The Inquisitor is an Outlaw combining the Spy and the Priest, available at the Tavern, Saloon, and Monastery from the Commerce Age onward. In addition to healing, its torch inflicts Burning Damage on enemy units, causing their hitpoints to slowly decline upon contact. They deal bonus damage against mercenaries and are powerful against Villagers and buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="162480">Heresy trials existed throughout Europe throughout the middle ages, but following the breakout of the infamous book Malleus Maleficarum, such superstition would reach unprecedented levels. As church matters fell increasingly under the discretion of small independent heads of state, these inquisitors would interrogate their subjects through torture and abuse, more often than not resulting in a burning or hanging. The prosecution process was often so macabre that many of those accused would rather openly admit to witchcraft than plead their innocence.\nThough inquisitors were prevalent throughout Britain, Spain, and Italy, they were particularly rampant throughout the Holy Roman Empire, particularly after its adoption of Constitutio Criminalis Carolina in 1530, which greatly reduced the impartiality of all witchcraft trials by concentrating nearly all power in the hands of the judge. The devastating aftermath of the Thirty Years' War saw the peak of witchcraft hysteria in Germany, where witches were pinned as scapegoats for the ensuing famine and economic meltdown.</string>
    <string _locid="162481">Ranger</string>
    <string _locid="162482">The Ranger is a quick ranged infantry unit with high ranged resistance but low hit points. It becomes available once the ‘Rangers’ card has been sent. This card replaces the training of archaic Longbowmen in the Barracks with Rangers.</string>
    <string _locid="162483">When the British Empire began to expand into the heart of North America, it soon found out that traditional volley tactics, long employed to great effect by their Longbowmen and Musketeers, proved ineffectual in the rugged, heavily forested terrain of the frontier land. Following the devastating Braddock’s Defeat as part of the French and Indian War in 1755, the British founded the King’s Royal Rifle Corps, a regiment of infantrymen who adopted warfare tactics used by Native Americans to adapt to their new environment. These included the use of lighter weapons that allowed for greater mobility, as well as the early use of camouflage. The 95th Experimental Rifles complimented the King’s Royal Rifle Corps through the use of Baker Rifles, which, while taking longer to reload, could snipe targets from over twice the distance of muskets, making the regiment much more versatile. The impact of these innovations was so decisive that the Rifle Corps would soon become a staple of nearly all major battles in British military history henceforth.\nBecause of their adeptness to the fickle climate of North America, riflemen formed much of the backbone of early American colonial armies. At the start of the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress founded 10 rifle companies in response to the British attacks on Lexington and Concord. Among the ranks of these riflemen were veterans of Roger’s Rangers, a recruitment of frontiersmen who fought during the French and Indian War.</string>
    <string _locid="162484">Cossack Daredevil</string>
    <string _locid="162485">The Cossack Daredevil is an Outlaw unit available at the Tavern, Saloon, and Monastery beginning in the Commerce Age. It is a cheap melee cavalry unit with low hit-points and no attack multipliers, but a fast movement speed. Its swift sabre deals high amount of damage per second and it can deal a powerful charge attack with its lance after killing a certain number of units. Cossack Daredevils may be dismounted into ranged infantry units that primarily attack with pistols, but can also charge up a knife that deals ranged melee damage.</string>
    <string _locid="162486">The term ‘Cossack’ originated in the Cuman language, meaning “free man”, and was used in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to describe refugees in the Ukrainian steppe, where they developed a distinct social and military culture. A special unit of registered Cossacks formed the Zaporozhian Army, which fought on behalf of the Commonwealth against Tatar and Turkish incursions near the Black Sea in exchange for land and privileges. However, due to increasingly unfavorable economic policies levied by the Polish government, several Cossacks began to instigate uprisings against their Polish overlords during the early 1600s. The Poles quashed these rebellions, but the Cossacks continued to thrive with relative autonomy, often participating in Russian and Moldavian affairs. The Cossacks would greatly contribute to the development of the modern Ukrainian national identity during their pervasive struggle against the Poles and Russians. Following the demise of the Zaporozhian Sich in 1775, the Cossack system collapsed; various attempts to revive the regiments occurred over the following several decades, but the results were only marginal at-best.</string>
    <string _locid="162487">Scholar</string>
    <string _locid="162488">The Scholar is a Level 1 land route trader, available at the Trade Post from the beginning of the game. They may only yield Experience when active and they cannot generate other resources.</string>
    <string _locid="162489">Universities had existed in Europe since the High Middle Ages, but it was only during the Renaissance period that they became an integral part of royal affairs. With the decline of feudalism, a growing class of professionals traveled far distances to receive education from scholars who promoted the burgeoning academia of the era. The father of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther, was influenced by his findings as a professor at the University of Wittenberg, while the Belgian physician Andreas Vesalius revolutionized common understanding of human anatomy, resulting in doctors becoming more invaluable than ever. By the end of the 16th century, scholars wielded arguably the greatest amount influence on the course of European history, eventually culminating in the Age of Enlightenment, where great academics such as Voltaire, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, and Benjamin Franklin shaped the foundations of modern political society.</string>
    <string _locid="162490">Trade Boat, River Trader</string>
    <string _locid="162491">The River Trader is a Level 1 trade unit, available at the Trading Post starting in the Discovery Age. When active, it can only increase the experience resource and cannot yield food, wood, or coin.</string>
    <string _locid="162492">Maritime commerce in Europe dates back several hundred years. Because rivers often formed the political boundaries of emerging states, merchants frequently preferred to travel by water instead of land. The Danube River played a particularly important role in European river trade, since it passed through the territories of several different powers, stretching all the way from Germany to the Black Sea. Other significant trade networks existed along the banks of the Volga River, which passed through much of Russia; the Rhine, which branched from the swampy Dutch Lowlands to the mountainous Alps; and the Elbe, which connected many influential cities throughout the vast Holy Roman Empire.</string>
    <string _locid="162493">Trade Boat, Cargo Boat</string>
    <string _locid="162494">The Cargo Boat is a Level 2 trade unit, available at the Trading Post. Access to the unit requires the Waterways technology in the Commerce Age. Unlike the River Boat, the Cargo Boat is able to stockpile food, wood, and coin when produced.</string>
    <string _locid="162495">Early modern armies increasingly depended on the deployment of heavy artillery. To ease the burden of transporting large arsenals across the plains, swamps, and hills of Europe, shipwrights built massive prams for the sole purpose of carrying military equipment around the fickle terrain.\nAs cargo ships grew in capacity, demand for them skyrocketed. To fully realize their potential and to ensure safe passage in times of war, engineers built elaborate waterways that linked major bodies of water all across the European continent. Some of the most important canals during the early modern period include the Eider-Kanal, which opened direct trade between the Baltic and North Seas, as well as the Canal du Midi, which allowed ships to travel from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via France.</string>
    <string _locid="162496">Trade Boat, Barge</string>
    <string _locid="162497">The Barge is a maritime trade unit that becomes available at the Trading Post upon researching River Traffic in the Industrial Age. It generates resources and experience at a faster rate than the Cargo Boat.</string>
    <string _locid="162498">As river trade networks grew in quantity and importance, managing waterway traffic became an increasingly onerous process. To carry large amounts of cargo without sacrificing efficiency, larger and larger vessels had to be constructed. Moving such heavy Trade Boats down rivers typically required a frightful amount of manpower, but with the invention of the steam engine during the Industrial Revolution, manual labor ceased to be a serious obstacle, making it more feasible to construct enormous Barges for the purpose of commerce. Since the strength of early steam engines was limited, merchants often turned to chain ships, whose innovative use of chain pulleys greatly reduced the amount of power necessary for steam engines to operate successfully. Chain ships dominated continental maritime trade throughout the 19th century until improvements to steam engines allowed them to work autonomously.</string>
    <string _locid="162499">Beast</string>
    <string _locid="162500">Scientific name: Belua maxima\nApproximate size: 214cm; 137kg\nDiet: Carnivorous, especially humans and horses\n\n The Beast is a semi-fictitious canine native to the European continent, based on the folklore of lycanthropy in Europe. In Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, it is an unpredictable creature that poses a deadly threat to any unit that provokes it.</string>
    <string _locid="162501">Tree, Poplar</string>
    <string _locid="162502">Poplars are deciduous trees native to temperate climates all over the world. They lend themselves well to carving and shaping, and have been popular media for art – most famously Italian Renaissance wood panel paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.</string>
    <string _locid="162503">Tree, Cypress</string>
    <string _locid="162504">Cypresses are coniferous evergreen trees native to climates all over the world. They have served a variety of purposes from ornamental usage in gardens to timbering. The cypress’ firm, durable wood made it an ideal construction material.</string>
    <string _locid="162505">Promotions</string>
    <string _locid="162506">Promotions are a concept unique to certain units in Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition. These units can improve pre-defined statistics by “leveling up” when they defeat an enemy unit. Promotions represent the historical (and modern) military phenomenon of troops honing their skills and being promoted in rank as they gain additional battle experience.</string>
    <string _locid="162507">Boyar</string>
    <string _locid="162508">The Boyar is a heavy hand cavalry unit armed with a sabre. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the Houses of Phanar by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Boyars have high hit points and a decent attack like Hussars. Their faster attack speed against units and buildings makes Boyars formidable at raiding.</string>
    <string _locid="162509">Boyar has been a high noble rank in Eastern and South Eastern Europe since the early middle ages. For most of the medieval period this hereditary class of wealthy landowners wielded great political power and enjoyed various privileges. Throughout the ages the status, power, and obligations associated with the boyar title saw different regional interpretations and stratifications. Mandatory military service or the emergence of a class for landless boyars were common developments.\nIn the Danubian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia several boyar classes existed that were tied to the ownership of land, serfs, and high offices in administration or military. As most of the Balkans had been under Ottoman rule for hundreds of years Boyars tended to serve the Ottoman Porte. Subsequently affairs of boyar families became closely entangled with those of the Ottoman royal court where they occupied high offices. This trend increased in the 18th century during the Phanariot era which saw a strong growth in boyar numbers. When independence movements were on the rise in Greece, Bulgaria, Moldavia and Romania many boyar families fell out of favor at the Ottoman Porte and eventually encouraged them to pursue influential positions within the new nations of the Balkans.</string>
    <string _locid="162510">Royal Dragoon</string>
    <string _locid="162511">The Royal Dragoon is a ranged light cavalry unit. It is available in the Fortress Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the House of Bourbon by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. Royal Dragoons are slower and more expensive than Dragoons but have higher range and hit points. Unlike other ranged cavalry units Royal Dragoons can use the trample stance and have a comparatively strong melee attack.</string>
    <string _locid="162512">The House of Bourbon ruled much of France and the surrounding regions from the medieval period up through the 19th century. Dragoons played an important role for Bourbon rulers in France to exert and protect their domestic and military power. In a policy known as the Dragonnades Bourbon king Louis XIV ordered Dragoons to tyrannize the Protestant Huguenots to coerce them either into conversion to Catholicism or emigration. Dragoons also served in the military branch of the royal household troops that did not only act as personal bodyguards but also participated in several campaigns.</string>
    <string _locid="162513">Bashibozuk</string>
    <string _locid="162514">The Bashibozuk is a unique Ottoman ranged infantry unit with a good attack against siege units like Grenadiers, but diminishing hitpoints. When your town is under attack and you don't have an army ready to defend it, call out the Bashibozuks. They will come from the Town Center and fight off attackers.\n \nAs soon as the Bashibozuks appear, their hitpoints start to decrease. This makes their hitpoint bar act like a timer, indicating how long they are effective. When their hitpoints drop to one the Bashibozuks can still move and fight, but taking any more damage kills them. You should therefore use them largely for defense against a surprise attack.</string>
    <string _locid="162515">The term Bashibozuk means "crazy head" and is a nickname for irregular combatants of the Ottoman army who joined voluntarily during times of war. They did not receive a salary and were instead motivated by the prospect of plunder. Due to their courage in battle there have been several efforts to convert Bashibozuks into regular troops, but due to their lack of discipline and notoriety for looting, these attempts proved unsuccessful. Eventually Bashibozuk troops were disbanded in the 19th century although self-organized bands continued to exist until the end of the Ottoman Empire.</string>
    <string _locid="162516">Sacred Band Infantry</string>
    <string _locid="162517">The Sacred Band Infantry is a ranged heavy infantry. It is available in the Commerce Age at the Trading Post to anyone who has allied with the Houses of Phanar by building a Trading Post on one of their palaces. The unit can only be accessed through the Trading Post's ability "Greek Revolution" that spawns more Sacred Band Infantry the longer you wait. Compared to a Musketeer, it has less hit points and attack but higher range and reload speed. In larger groups the Sacred Band Infantry also becomes stronger.</string>
    <string _locid="162518">The Houses of Phanar held considerable influence in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans from the 16th century through the 19th century. At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821-29) Phanariot general Alexander Ypsilantis formed the first military volunteer unit of the conflict, the Sacred Band. Their dark uniforms were directly inspired by those of the Black Brunswickers, a German volunteer force that successfully fought against Napoleon's occupation. The unit's name was a reference to the Sacred Band of Thebes that was considered an elite force in Ancient Greece. Although the unit did not survive the war of independence its initiative to pick up arms inspired other Greeks to do the same.</string>
    <string _locid="162519">The Tatar Archer is a ranged light cavalry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age to anyone who has built a Trading Post at the Tengri Shrine. Tatar Archers are swift horse archers that can attack rapidly in melee and at range. They are particularly effective against cavalry, but deal very little damage to other units.</string>
    <string _locid="162520">In the daily lives and belief systems of steppe peoples horses were indispensable as mounts to communicate and travel in the vastness of the steppe. Horse archery started out as a way to hunt fast or distant animals but very quickly evolved into the chief component of steppe warfare. The swiftness and agility of horses paired with the rider’s archery skills were the ideal fit for surprise raids and flanking maneuvers. Prime examples for the effectiveness of such warfare were the Mongol Empire under the leadership of Genghis Khan as well as the Golden Horde and its Tatar successor states.</string>
    <string _locid="162521">This Holy Site is identical to a Native Trade Site. Allying with Natives allows a player to train special Native units, usually warriors, and also grants access to a group of improvements to that tribe. Native units do not cost any population spaces, but can only be built in limited numbers.\n\nTengrism is an ancient animistic religion that was widespread in North and Central Asia. The sky god “tengri” is its main deity and was worshiped next to many natural spirits and souls. In Tengrism and related beliefs high elevations like mountain peaks are considered sacred places due to their proximity to the sky. The "ovoo" is a man-made stone heap that represents a peak and therefore acts as a shrine.\n\n The political legitimacy of rulers in Turko-Mongol societies and states was connected to Tengri and comparable to the Chinese “mandate of heaven” or European “divine right of kings”. The royal Mongol chronicle from the 13th century CE claims for instance that the ancestors of Genghis Khan are descendants of Tengri.</string>
    <string _locid="162522">The Qizilbash is a ranged heavy cavalry unit. It is available in the Commerce Age to anyone who has built a Trading Post at the Sufi Mosque. Armed with a lance and a bow this unit acts like a lancer with an additional ranged attack. The lance of the Qizilbash has increased range and will automatically be used if an enemy unit is close enough. The melee attack inflicts bonus damage against infantry. Although the bow attack does not share this bonus, it enables the Qizilbash to perform hit-and-run tactics.</string>
    <string _locid="162523">The Qizilbash were semi-nomadic Turkomans from Anatolia, Caucasia and Mesopotamia who brought ancient Turkic religion and steppe traditions into harmony with Islamic spirituality and Sufi mysticism. The name “qizilbash” means “red head” which refers to their crimson red conic headwear and is a symbol of their allegiance to Shia Twelver Islam.\n\nDuring the 15th century the Qizilbash were the military backbone of the Safavids, a Sufi order and dynasty from Ardabil. They traveled light on horseback and fought with lances and traditional Turkic bows.\n\nThe military successes of the Qizilbash in Persia enabled their Safavid leaders to found their own state, the Safavid Empire.</string>
    <string _locid="162524">The Corsair Marksman is a ranged infantry outlaw unit that may be hired at the Tavern, Saloon, or Monastery beginning in the Commerce Age. The Hausa civilization can access this unit through their Moroccan alliance from the Watch Tower. This outlaw is only available on maps from The African Royals expansion. \nAs a skirmisher unit the Corsair Marksman is good against Heavy infantry. Additionally he also inflicts extra damage against treasure guardians and villagers, making him a useful unit for early raids and treasure hunts.</string>
    <string _locid="162525">The powers of the Maghreb came early into contact with gunpowder weaponry due to the proximity to Europe as well as the ties to the Ottoman Empire. Although the Barbary States were connected to maritime and inner-African trade routes their access to firearms and particularly artillery remained limited. Especially the Mediterranean powers that suffered from raids of the Barbary corsairs prevented the trade of firearms. To overcome this limited supply firearms were increasingly manufactured locally. A prominent example that achieved this is the “moukahla”, also known as Kabyle musket – named after the Kabyle people – that had a formidable range due to its long barrel.</string>
    <string _locid="162526">The Tengri Wolf is a native pet. It is available in the Commerce Age to anyone who has built a Trading Post at the Tengri Shrine. Tengri Wolves are fast pets that are particularly effective against treasure guardians and other pets.</string>
    <string _locid="162527">The domestication of canine animals already started in prehistoric times. Scientific hypotheses assume that individual wolves with a higher acceptance for humans were more likely to be tolerated – and less likely to be killed – by humans as opposed to more aggressive counterparts. The raising of orphaned wild animals has particularly high chances to foster lasting familial bonds with humans. Relationships of trust between humans and canines as well as the increased food dependency ultimately led to the domestication of canines and enabled their use as guard animals and hunting dogs.\nIn Turko-Mongol folklore wolves are worshiped as legendary founders and ancestors of their peoples, akin to the founding myth of the city of Rome telling of two brothers – Romulus and Remus – nursed by a she-wolf. According to written Mongol sources Genghis Khan is said to be a distant relative of “Borte Chino”, a gray-blue wolf from the sky.</string>
    <string _locid="162528">The Merchant is the unique resource gatherer for the Dutch. Unlike the Settler, the Merchant costs coins instead of food. This requires a unique resource management from the start of the game with a higher focus on early mining. Fortunately Merchants are better than Settlers at gathering coin from Mines and Estates, but can be trained in much smaller numbers. The construction of coin-producing Banks helps the Dutch economy to ensure a steady coin income and supply of Merchants.</string>
    <string _locid="162529">The Dutch Golden Age describes a period of enormous prosperity that lasted roughly hundred years beginning with the proclamation of the Dutch Republic in 1588. The economic success is largely attributed to a series of technological revolutions in the fields of shipbuilding, agriculture and industrial production. These developments enabled the Dutch republic to become a naval power and dominate naval trade with the largest merchant fleet of the 17th century. The foundation of chartered companies, particularly the “Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie” – better known as the Dutch East India Company – were pivotal in expanding the trade opportunities internationally through a network of trading posts, ports, and colonies. Trade monopolies with Japan or the so-called “Spice Islands” of Maluku are emblematic of the company’s reach and power.</string>
    <string _locid="162530">The Landwehr is an unique German ranged infantry unit that can replace the Crossbowman if the Scharnhorst Reform card has been sent. Like the Crossbowman, this unit costs only wood and food making it affordable even in greater numbers. The Landwehr inflicts less bonus damage than the Crossbowman, but deals higher base damage instead. This allows the unit to be used a bit like a Musketeer, a unit that is not available to the Germans. Despite this similarity, Landwehrs have low hit points and are particularly vulnerable to cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162531">The Landwehr was a new type of conscript army that became common in German states during the early 19th century. The German word “Landwehr” can be translated as “Territorial Defense”. In the Napoleonic Wars the German standing armies suffered great losses, which they could not compensate for quickly enough. German soldiers were first defeated by Napoleon's army and then forcibly recruited into it.\nTo make up for the loss of professional soldiers various states started in the years 1813-1815 to mass conscript men aged 17 to 40 fit for military service. Prussian General Gerhard von Scharnhorst already created a rapidly trained military reserve through his designed Krümper system in 1808 that allowed the Prussian army to increase its mancount. His reforms are therefore generally considered to have laid the groundwork for the Landwehr armies and eventually the introduction of compulsory military service.\n\nThe quality of training and equipment varied greatly between the German states and it was not uncommon for conscripts to lack basics such as shoes or muskets. Despite these obvious deficits the Landwehr was treated as an integral part of the army and featured characteristic subdivisions such as line infantry, light infantry, and cavalry.</string>
    <string _locid="162532">The Azap is a unique Ottoman heavy infantry unit with a ranged attack and replaces the Pikeman. It is available at the Barracks starting in the Commerce Age costing only food and wood. Like Pikemen, Azaps counter all cavalry in melee combat with their Ottoman halberd. Azaps are not as fast as Pikemen and do not inflict as much siege damage, but their bows allow them to counter Light Cavalry at range.</string>
    <string _locid="162533">The Azaps were lightly armored foot soldiers primarily fighting with a variety of archaic hand and ranged weapons such as halberds, maces, sabers and bows. The word “azap” literally means “bachelor”, describing an unmarried man. Initially recruited from young men belonging to the lower classes of Ottoman society, Azaps were numerous and often trusted with guard and naval service or logistical support.\n\nIn the Ottoman line of battle the Azaps were positioned in front of the Janissaries and artillery to repel or bind advancing enemy forces. Once the first line of enemy combatants was weakened the Azaps would withdraw and enable the rested Janissaries and artillery to counterattack. Due to this pivotal role in Ottoman battle tactics Azaps remained active and relevant in the era of gunpowder despite their archaic weaponry.</string>
    <string _locid="162534">The Yörük is the unique resource gatherer for the Ottomans. Unlike Settlers, Merchants, or Villagers the Yörük cannot be trained manually, but instead arrives for free at the Town Center. Initially Yörüks train slower and start with a low build limit. Both of these traits need to be improved through technologies in the Mosque, the Ottoman Church replacement. With multiple Town Centers and all Mosque technologies researched the Ottomans can ensure a steady influx of Yörüks and build a powerful economy.</string>
    <string _locid="162535">The Turkish word “Yörük” describes wandering persons and specifically refers to groups of Oghuz Turks who continued the nomadic way of life from the Central Asian steppe within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. They made their living through animal husbandry and mostly lived in tents which they set up on the plains or plateaus according to the seasons.\n\nThe Ottoman administration used the designation “Yörüks” in separation from the sedentary Turkmens and considered them a major contributor to the establishment of a permanent Turkic population in newly conquered lands of the Ottoman Empire. Most Yörüks were sent to settle in Anatolia and especially in the Balkans, where the Ottoman viziers encouraged them to settle down by bestowing them with lands suitable for farming. Many Yörüks followed this invitation and either settled permanently or continued a semi-nomadic life.</string>
    <string _locid="162536">The Deli is a unique heavy cavalry unit and replaces the Hussars for the Ottomans. It is available at the Stable in the Commerce Age. Like the Hussar, the Deli has many hit points, but moves and attacks faster at the expense of lower damage.</string>
    <string _locid="162537">The Delis were a cavalry unit established in the Balkans during the 15th century to serve the Ottoman army as scouts and vanguard. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 the Ottomans greatly expanded their military efforts to the Balkans, a region which they called Rumelia. In this endeavor the Ottoman commanders were reliant on local volunteers to guide the army through the mountainous territory and conduct raids behind enemy lines. In battle the Delis would act as shock cavalry and ferociously charge at the enemy with lances. Due to their flamboyant outfits and fearless courage in combat they were called “deli” which literally translates to “lunatic” or “daredevil” in Turkish. They wore furs of predators like lions, bears and tigers as well as many bird feathers to mimic feral animals and intimidate enemy soldiers. Their martial appearance and battle prowess made Delis appealing to high-ranking Ottoman officials as personal guards.</string>
    <string _locid="162538">The Humbaraci is a heavy ranged infantry that replaces the Grenadier for the Ottomans. It is already available in the Commerce Age at the Artillery Foundry and operates like a short-ranged artillery unit that throws grenades, which inflict damage in an area.\n\nUnlike Grenadiers, they are not only effective against buildings, but also against artillery. Higher movement speed, hit points, attack range and additional resistance against siege attacks allows Humbaracis to approach enemy artillery more safely. This specialization comes at the cost of smaller area damage and reduced resistance against ranged attacks, making the Humbaraci less effective against infantry than Grenadiers.\n\nLike European Grenadiers, the Humbaraci can be equipped with hand mortars with greater range by sending the Grenade Launchers card.</string>
    <string _locid="162539">The Humbaraci corps was one of the divisions of the Ottoman Army and is commonly considered to be the earliest specialized Grenadier corps in the early modern period. The Ottomans already started to use grenades in the late 15th and early 16th century, preceding this development in European armies. The name “humbaraci” is based on a Persian loanword that describes a metal bowl for storing valuables. This was likened to the metallic gunpowder-filled grenade and therefore called “humbara”. The Ottoman army intended to emulate the power of the cumbersome and slow-moving artillery with more mobile foot soldiers by equipping and training small detachments of infantry banners with grenades. The Humbaraci corps also had extensive knowledge of casting and operating artillery pieces such as mortars. This expertise made them valuable in both infantry and artillery troops.</string>
    <string _locid="162540">The Rekrut is an unique Russian heavy ranged infantry unit replacing the Musketeer. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and can be trained in groups of 5 in the Blockhouse. Like Musketeers the Rekrut is a good allrounder unit with an attack bonus against cavalry in hand-to-hand fighting. The low training costs of Rekruts come at the expense of reduced combat capabilities. Although they have less hitpoints and damage values compared to a Musketeer Rekruts can still overwhelm enemies by outnumbering them.</string>
    <string _locid="162541">At the end of the 17th century Russian emperor Peter the Great made big efforts to reform the Russian army and adopt the more modern model of European armies. This reorganization affected everything from equipment, recruitment, regiment sizes, tactics to chain of command and ranks. By that time the archaic Streltsy regiments had already fallen out of favor with the emperor due to corruption and numerous uprisings - and were soon disbanded.\n\nContrary to tradition the new standing army of the Russian empire no longer primarily relied on recruits from higher social strata but introduced conscription for peasantry and townsfolk, too. As was customary for this period in history recruits were pressed into service rather than being given an actual choice. Until the end of the 18th century service in the Russian army was for life and only reduced to 25 years in 1793. A “rekrut” (recruit) of the infantry in the new regular army was trained in linear tactics and issued a musket with a bayonet. Previously simply called "soldat” (soldier) in the Streltsy army the lowest rank in the Imperial army was “ryadovoy” and equivalent to the rank “private”. Uniforms of the Russian imperial army were predominantly green, a color that was usually reserved for the light infantry in other European armies. The new conscription model as well as the great population size and increases starting in the 18th century allowed the Russian army to heavily outnumber its opponents on the battlefield. Despite difficulties in supplies and training the numerical superiority frequently worked in the imperial army's favor consistently culminating in the enemy's military defeat. </string>
    <string _locid="162542">The Poruchik is a unique Russian heavy hand infantry unit replacing the Halberdier. It is available starting in the Commerce Age and can be trained in groups of 4 in the Blockhouse. Like Halberdiers the Poruchiks are powerful hand infantry units with good hitpoints and damage. They are particularly effective against cavalry, but have enough base damage to be a threat to other types of units as well. Compared to a Halberdier the Poruchik is cheaper, but offers less hitpoints and damage in exchange.</string>
    <string _locid="162543">The word “poruchik” is of Slavic origin and variably describes a person who receives orders or oversees something. In the Russian imperial army a Poruchik (“Lieutenant”) corresponds to a low company-grade or junior officer rank originally originating from the foreign mercenary regiments that were fighting for the Muscovite army. These mercenary regiments were often formed in German states and came with their own command structure which on its own had a lasting influence on the Muscovite and Imperial Russian armies. When emperor Peter the Great reformed the Russian army at the end of the 17th century he mostly sought to structure it after the Prussian model. In his “Table of Ranks” from 1722 he replaced most hereditary titles of nobility in the army and government institutions with new ranks. Many of these historical ranks such as Rittmeister (German for “Riding Master”), Fendrik (after German “Fähnrich”, a flag-bearer) or Stabs-Ofitser (after German “Stabsoffizier”, a senior officer) give testimony to this German influence. \n\nWhereas most officers in the Muscovite standing army were nobles officers in the reformed imperial army could also be commoners who proved their talent. In both armies the ranks of officers could be easily recognized by the colored tassels of their partisans, a polearm similar to a spontoon or halberd.\n\nA company-grade officer of rank such as the Poruchik would typically assume the command of 40 up to 100 soldiers. Greater military units like a Russian regiment (“polk”) featuring hundreds of soldiers was instead commanded by a polkovnik or brigadier, two ranks that already belong to superior rank group, the senior officers. </string>
    <string _locid="162544">The Counter Dragoon is an unique Russian light cavalry unit available at the Stable in the Industrial Age. It performs the role of an ordinary Dragoon to fight heavy cavalry, but actually specializes in countering other light cavalry units and artillery at range. Due to this specialized role he offers lower hitpoints and base damage in exchange for higher attack multipliers and ranged resistance. In his melee attack the counter roles are reversed and the unit performs better against heavy cavalry.\n\nCounter Dragoons can dismount from their horses to turn into Counter Jaegers. These units are light ranged infantry units that are better at countering other Skirmisher and Light ranged cavalry units than Heavy ranged infantry such as Musketeers.</string>
    <string _locid="162545">Unlike in many other European armies the roles of Russian dragoons were not limited to reconnaissance and small skirmishes. Instead dragoons made up the main battlefield cavalry of the Russian empire by the end of the 18th century. Accordingly these dragoons were trained in melee combat and drilled in cavalry tactics such as repeated melee charges or flanking attacks. Next to saber and pistols they were also armed with rifles which they variably shot from horseback or by foot. In the cavalry formation these rifles were primarily used on the flanks for defensive purposes, leading to their description as flankers.\n\nIn the Napoleonic Wars the St. Petersburg Dragoons managed to capture the flags of four French regiments, including one cuirassier regiment. Compared to most other European powers at the time the Russian army had the highest ratio of cavalry to infantry, allowing it to easily compete with elite cavalry regiments of other states. \n\nDespite their specialization as battlefield cavalry the dragoons continued to carry out duties standing in the tradition of dragoons as mounted infantry. Dismounted these soldiers were able to conduct the "little war" in urban environments and sieges to sabotage enemy supplies and harass infantry forces. This was by definition a role of the “Jaegers”, another specialized force that like the elite dragoons appeared comparably late in the Russian army.</string>
    <string _locid="162546">The Muhbir is an unique Ottoman spy available in the Commerce Age at the Mosque. Like the Spy the Muhbir has the Stealth ability and is highly effective against mercenaries and hero units such as Explorers and War Chiefs. For each eliminated threat the Muhbir is rewarded with a promotion that increases his combat abilities. When cornered by enemy troops Muhbirs will attack faster with decreasing hitpoints.</string>
    <string _locid="162547">To rule and ensure the political stability of their ever-growing multicultural empire the Ottomans were in constant need of spies to keep an eye on the growing population. From the 15th to 17th century Muhbirs (Turkish for “informants”) were internal security forces mostly recruited from the local population as these agents could move freely within societies without arising suspicion.\n\nOver the centuries the spying efforts among European countries and within the Ottoman Empire itself became more and more sophisticated. This development prompted Sultan Abdul Hamid II to found the Yildiz Intelligence Agency at the end of the 19th century to provide more organized intelligence and respond to internal as well as external threats.</string>
    <string _locid="163000">Tycoon</string>
    <string _locid="163001">The main objective of Tycoon is to reach the highest Tycoon Score possible. Players should prioritize building economic units and buildings then upgrading their technologies to increase overall resource gain.\n\nPlayers can also gain Tycoon Score through unique systems, only available in this new game mode.</string>
    <string _locid="163002">Tycoon - Economy Challenges</string>
    <string _locid="163003">Completing Economic Challenges will grant Tycoon Score bonuses.\n\nThe system allows all players to compete over who will reach certain milestones on a ranked basis. The Economic Challenges menu can be opened through the in-game HUD for a more detailed view.</string>
    <string _locid="163004">Tycoon - Tycoon Packages</string>
    <string _locid="163005">Players are able to purchase Tycoon packages, which act as an alternative to training military units which would occur frequently in other game modes. Tycoon packagess exchange their cost for an equal amount of Tycoon Score and grant a bonus of up to 25%. The bonus % is reduced on each purchase, but slowly recovers over time.</string>
    <string _locid="163006">Tycoon - Cease Fire</string>
    <string _locid="163007">Cease fire is a game rule to rule out early-game rush tactics. This option can be turned off in the lobby.</string>
    <string _locid="163008">Tycoon - Military</string>
    <string _locid="163009">With the exception of Explorers, all Military Units in Economic Mode incur Hitpoint decay, similar to that of existing Militia and Levy-type units. This helps further shift the focus away from combative gameplay, as strong Military units cannot be stockpiled, and must be utilised quickly after being trained.</string>
    <string _locid="163010">Tycoon - Victory Conditions</string>
    <string _locid="163011">For breakaway players and teams, scoring much higher than others, there is a special victory condition called Economic Victory. To achieve an Economic Victory, players must maintain a lead of 10,000 Tycoon Score and be in the final Age. This is similar to King of the Hill victory or Trade Monopoly. This has been implemented to allow for decisive victories, rewarding the most powerful economies.</string>
